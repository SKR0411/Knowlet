        <h2 id="p2">2. [span_35](start_span)Structure of honey comb[span_35](end_span)</h2>
        <p>You will identify a piece of natural or framed honeycomb. Look for these features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Material:</strong> The comb is made of <strong>beeswax</strong>, secreted by worker bees.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Composed of <strong>hexagonal cells</strong>. This shape is the most efficient, using the minimum amount of wax to store the maximum amount of honey.</li>
            <li><strong>Cell Types:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Worker Cells:</strong> The most numerous and smallest cells. Used to raise worker bees and to store honey and pollen (bee bread).</li>
                    <li><strong>Drone Cells:</strong> Noticeably larger than worker cells. Used to raise drones. Often located on the edges of the comb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queen Cells:</strong> Very large, <strong>peanut-shaped</strong> cells that hang vertically from the comb. Used only for raising a new queen.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contents:</strong> You may see capped honey (covered with a white wax cap), capped brood (covered with a darker, brownish cap), pollen (packed, colorful), or open cells with larvae.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="p3">3. [span_36](start_span)Morphological peculiarities of worker bees[span_36](end_span)</h2>
        <p>This involves identifying the specialized body parts (adaptations) of a worker bee that allow it to perform its jobs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pollen Basket (Corbicula):</strong> A wide, concave, polished area on the outer surface of the hind tibia (leg), surrounded by stiff hairs. Used to transport large pellets of pollen.</li>
            <li><strong>Honey Stomach (Crop):</strong> An internal organ (not visible externally) for transporting nectar back to the hive.</li>
            <li><strong>Wax Glands:</strong> (Also internal/microscopic) Located on the ventral (under) side of the abdomen, secreting wax scales.</li>
            <li><strong>Barbed Stinger:</strong> A modified ovipositor (egg-laying organ) at the tip of the abdomen. The barbs cause it to lodge in the skin of mammals, and the bee dies after stinging.</li>
            <li><strong>Proboscis:</strong> The "tongue" of the bee. A set of modified mouthparts adapted for sucking up liquids like nectar and water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="p4">4. [span_37](start_span)Identification of bee keeping instruments and bee hives[span_37](end_span)</h2>
        <p>This is a "spotting" exercise to identify the tools of the trade.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Langstroth Hive:</strong> The large, rectangular, multi-box hive. Identify its parts: <strong>Bottom Board, Brood Chamber, Super, Frames, Inner Cover, Top Cover</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Newton Hive:</strong> A smaller, single-box hive used for <em>Apis cerana</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Bee Veil:</strong> The mesh hat/helmet used to protect the face.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoker:</strong> The metal can with bellows used to puff smoke.</li>
            <li><strong>Hive Tool:</strong> The L-shaped or J-shaped crowbar used for prying frames.</li>
            <li><strong>Honey Extractor:</strong> The large centrifuge (drum) used to spin honey out of frames.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncapping Knife:</strong> A special knife (often electric or heated) used to slice the wax caps off honeycombs.</li>
            <li><strong>Queen Excluder:</strong> A flat grid designed to keep the queen out of the honey supers.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This practical requires you to observe a real-world apiary and document your findings. Your report should be structured, clear, and scientific.</p>
        <h3>Structure for your Report / Presentation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Introduction:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To study the practices of bee rearing and management at [Name of Farm].</li>
                    <li><strong>Date and Location:</strong> When and where was the visit?</li>
                    <li><strong>Brief Overview:</strong> A short summary of the farm (e.g., "a 50-colony apiary specializing in litchi honey").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2. Observations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apiary Site:</strong> Describe the location. Was it near water? What was the pasturage? Was there a windbreak?</li>
                    <li><strong>Bee Species:</strong> What species was being hived (e.g., <em>Apis mellifera</em>)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Hive Type:</strong> What type of hives were used (e.g., Langstroth)?</li>

                    <li><strong>Colony Health:</strong> Did you observe brood, pollen, and honey? Did the colonies seem strong?</li>
                    <li><strong>Honey Extraction:</strong> (If observed) Describe the process. Was it modern or traditional?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>What are the main challenges (e.g., diseases, pests, low prices, pesticide use by nearby farmers)?</li>
                    <li>What is the economics (e.g., cost of one hive vs. annual profit)?</li>
                    <li>What government support, if any, do they receive?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
