        <h3>Meaning of Political Science</h3>
        <p>The term 'Political Science' is derived from two words: 'Politics' and 'Science'.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Politics:</strong> From the Greek word 'Polis', meaning city-state. It refers to the art and practice of governing, managing public affairs, and the struggles for power.</li>
            <li><strong>Science:</strong> Denotes a systematic study of a subject, based on observation, analysis, and the formulation of principles.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Political Science is the systematic study of the state, government, power, and political processes. It analyzes how power is acquired, exercised, and distributed within a society.
        </blockquote>

        <span id="span_1"><h3>Nature of Political Science</h3></span>
        <p>The 'scientific' nature of Political Science has been a long-standing debate.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Is Political Science a Science? (Arguments For)</th>
                    <th>Is Political Science Not a Science? (Arguments Against)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Systematic Study:</strong> It involves observation, classification, and analysis of political facts and events.</td>
                    <td><strong>Lack of Universal Laws:</strong> Unlike natural sciences, it cannot produce universal, value-free laws (e.g., human behavior is not as predictable as chemical reactions).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Use of Scientific Methods:</strong> Modern political science (e.g., behavioralism) uses empirical methods, surveys, statistics, and data analysis.</td>
                    <td><strong>Subjectivity and Values:</strong> The study of politics is inherently value-laden. Notions of 'good' and 'bad' are central, unlike in physics.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Predictive Capability:</strong> It can make limited predictions about political behavior, such as voting patterns or the likelihood of conflict.</td>
                    <td><strong>No Laboratory:</strong> The world is the laboratory, and variables cannot be controlled in the same way.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><strong>Conclusion on Nature:</strong> Political Science is best described as a <strong>Social Science</strong>. It uses scientific methods to study social phenomena, but its subject (human behavior in political contexts) makes it different from natural sciences.</p>

        <span id="span_2"><h3>Scope of Political Science</h3></span>
        <p>The scope of Political Science is vast and has expanded significantly over time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Study of the State:</strong> The traditional core. It covers the origin, nature, and functions of the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Government:</strong> Analyzing the types, organs (legislature, executive, judiciary), and processes of government.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Power:</strong> Modern political science focuses on power as the central concept â€“ who holds it, how it's used, and how it's challenged.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Political Processes:</strong> Includes public opinion, political parties, interest groups, and elections.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Political Theory:</strong> Examines fundamental concepts like liberty, equality, justice, and sovereignty.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of International Relations:</strong> Analyzes the relationships between states, international organizations, and global issues.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <span id="span_3"><h3>Relevance of Political Science</h3></span>
        <p>The study of Political Science is highly relevant for several reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Creates Informed Citizens:</strong> It provides knowledge about our rights, duties, and the functioning of our government, which is essential for a healthy democracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Basis for Good Governance:</strong> It trains administrators, public servants, and leaders in the principles of public administration and policy-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Critical Thinking:</strong> It encourages critical analysis of political events, ideologies, and institutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Fosters Tolerance:</strong> By studying different political systems and ideas, it helps us understand and respect diverse viewpoints.</li>
            <li><strong>Solves Social Problems:</strong> Political analysis is crucial for understanding and finding solutions to complex problems like poverty, conflict, and environmental degradation.</li>
        </ol>

        <span id="span_4"><h2 id="relations">Relations with History, Economics and Sociology</h2></span>
        <p>Political Science is not an isolated discipline. It is deeply interconnected with other social sciences.</p>
        
        <h3>Political Science and History</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Seeley's Quote:</strong> "History without Political Science has no fruit; Political Science without History has no root."
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>History's Contribution to Political Science:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>History provides the raw material (facts, events) for political analysis.</li>
                    <li>Political institutions and ideas can only be understood by tracing their historical evolution.</li>
                    <li>History serves as a "laboratory" to test political theories.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Political Science's Contribution to History:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Political Science provides the analytical frameworks to interpret historical events.</li>
                    <li>The study of states, laws, and ideologies gives meaning to historical data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Political Science and Economics</h3>
        <p>The two fields are so intertwined that they were once studied together as 'Political Economy'.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Economics' Contribution to Political Science:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Economic conditions (like poverty or inequality) deeply influence political stability and behavior.</li>
                    <li>Many political conflicts are rooted in economic issues (e.g., resource distribution).</li>
                    <li>Economic systems (capitalism, socialism) are also political ideologies.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Political Science's Contribution to Economics:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Political decisions and government policies (e.g., taxation, trade) create the framework for the economy.</li>
                    <li>Political stability is a prerequisite for economic development.</li>
                    <li>The state plays a key role in regulating the economy and ensuring social welfare.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Political Science and Sociology</h3>
        <p>Sociology is the study of society and social relationships. Political Sociology is a major sub-field bridging the two.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sociology's Contribution to Political Science:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Politics does not happen in a vacuum; it happens within society. Sociology provides an understanding of social structures (like family, caste, class) that shape politics.</li>
                    <li>Sociological concepts like 'socialization' are key to understanding how political beliefs are formed (political socialization).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Political Science's Contribution to Sociology:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The state is a primary agent of social control and social change.</li>
                    <li>Laws passed by the state (e.g., on marriage, education) fundamentally shape social institutions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be ready to explain the interrelationship with a clear example. For instance: To understand the policy of 'reservations' (affirmative action) in India, you need:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Science:</strong> To understand the constitutional provisions (e.g., Right to Equality).</li>
                <li><strong>History:</strong> To understand the historical injustice of the caste system.</li>
                <li><strong>Sociology:</strong> To understand the current social structure and status of different castes.</li>
                <li><strong>Economics:</strong> To understand its impact on employment and economic mobility.</li>
            </ul>
