        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction: A Period of Fragmentation</h2>
        <p>The period after the Mauryan collapse (c. 185 BCE – 300 CE) is marked by political fragmentation. Two major trends occurred simultaneously:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Indigenous Dynasties:</strong> Regional powers like the Shungas (in Magadha) and Satavahanas (in the Deccan) replaced the Mauryas.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign Invasions:</strong> A series of invasions from Central Asia led to the establishment of Indo-Greek, Shaka, and Kushana kingdoms in the northwest.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="shungas">2. Shungas: Pushyamitra Shunga</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Founder:</strong> <strong>Pushyamitra Shunga</strong>, the Brahmin commander-in-chief of the last Mauryan king, Brihadratha.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise to Power:</strong> He assassinated Brihadratha in a public military parade (c. 185 BCE) and usurped the throne of Magadha.</li>
            <li><strong>Brahminical Revival:</strong> His reign is seen as a revival of Brahminism after the Mauryan patronage of Buddhism.
                <ul>
                    <li>He performed two <strong>Ashvamedha</strong> (horse) sacrifices.</li>
                    <li>Patanjali's *Mahabhashya* was written during this time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wars:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fought against the <strong>Bactrian Greeks</strong> (Yavanas) who were trying to push into the Ganga valley.</li>
                    <li>Fought against <strong>Kharavela</strong> of Kalinga.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Note:</strong> Despite being associated with a Hindu revival, major Buddhist sites like the <strong>Sanchi Stupa</strong> and <strong>Bharhut Stupa</strong> were expanded and decorated during the Shunga period, showing continued patronage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="kanishka">3. Kanishka: Conquests & Achievements</h2>
        <p>Kanishka was the greatest ruler of the <strong>Kushana Dynasty</strong>, a nomadic people from Central Asia (Yuezhi tribe) who established a vast empire.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Empire:</strong> His empire was massive, controlling North India (capitals at <strong>Purushapura/Peshawar</strong> and <strong>Mathura</strong>) and a large part of Central Asia.</li>
            <li><strong>Control of the Silk Road:</strong> His most significant economic achievement was controlling a large section of the <strong>Silk Road</strong>, which brought immense wealth through trade taxes.</li>
            <li><strong>Accession (Shaka Era):</strong> He started the <strong>Shaka Era in 78 CE</strong> to mark his ascension to the throne. This calendar is still used as the official calendar by the Government of India.</li>
            <li><strong>Patronage of Buddhism:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>He was a great patron of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He convened the <strong>Fourth Buddhist Council</strong> in Kashmir, where the Mahayana doctrine was finalized.</li>
                    <li>His patronage helped spread Buddhism to Central Asia and China.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Patronage of Art:</strong> His reign was the "golden age" of the <strong>Gandhara School of Art</strong> (Greco-Buddhist style) and the <strong>Mathura School of Art</strong> (indigenous style). The first images of the Buddha were created during this time.</li>
            <li><strong>Patronage of Scholars:</strong> His court included scholars like <strong>Ashvaghosha</strong> (wrote *Buddhacharita*) and <strong>Charaka</strong> (wrote *Charaka Samhita*, a foundational text on Ayurveda).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="kharavela">4. Kalinga ruler: Kharavela</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who:</strong> The powerful and famous king of <strong>Kalinga (modern Odisha)</strong>, belonging to the Chedi dynasty. He ruled in the 1st Century BCE.</li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Our <em>only</em> detailed source for his reign is the <strong>Hathigumpha (Elephant Cave) Inscription</strong> at Udayagiri, near Bhubaneswar.</li>
            <li><strong>Religion:</strong> He was a devout follower of <strong>Jainism</strong>. The inscription begins with a Jain prayer.</li>
            <li><strong>Achievements (from the inscription):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The inscription gives a year-by-year account of his first 13 regnal years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Works:</strong> He repaired his capital (Kalinganagari) which had been damaged by a storm and extended a canal (originally built by a Nanda king).</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Conquests:</strong> He was a great conqueror. He waged successful wars against the Satavahanas in the south and, most famously, against Magadha (then under the Shungas), which he invaded multiple times.</li>
                    <li>He is also said to have brought back Jain statues that had been taken away by Mahapadma Nanda centuries earlier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="satavahanas">5. The Satavahanas</h2>
        <p>Also known as the Andhras, the Satavahanas were the first major indigenous empire in the <strong>Deccan</strong>, acting as a bridge between the north and south.</p>
        
        <h3>i) Political achievements of Gautamiputra Satakarni</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greatest Ruler:</strong> Gautamiputra Satakarni (c. 106–130 CE) was the greatest ruler of the dynasty, who restored its power.</li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> His achievements are detailed in the <strong>Nasik Prasasti</strong> (inscription), which was issued by his mother, Gautami Balashri.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Achievement:</strong> His greatest victory was against the <strong>Shakas (Western Kshatrapas)</strong>. He defeated their king, <strong>Nahapana</strong>, and restruck his coins, a sign of total victory.</li>
            <li><strong>Titles:</strong> The inscription gives him grand titles, such as "Destroyer of the Shakas, Yavanas (Greeks), and Pahlavas (Parthians)" and "Lord of the Southern (Dakshinapatha) Lord".</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Administration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Their administration was based on the Mauryan model, but with crucial differences that point towards <strong>feudalism</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Structure:</strong> The kingdom was divided into districts (*Ahara*), but real power was often in the hands of local feudatories called <strong>Maharathis</strong> and <strong>Mahabhojas</strong>, who were often related to the king.</li>
            <li><strong>Land Grants (Crucial Feature):</strong> The Satavahanas were the <strong>first rulers in Indian history to issue royal land grants to Brahmins and Buddhist monks</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>These grants were often tax-free.</li>
                    <li>They also transferred administrative and judicial rights to the donee.</li>
                    <li>This practice weakened central control and is seen as a key step in the development of Indian feudalism.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Military Character:</strong> Administration had a military character. Rural areas were often controlled by *Gaulmikas* (head of a military regiment).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> The two most important long-term developments from this period are:
            <br>1. Kanishka's role in spreading <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong> and his control of the <strong>Silk Road</strong>.
            <br>2. The Satavahanas' introduction of <strong>religious land grants</strong>, which is the beginning of the feudal system in India.
