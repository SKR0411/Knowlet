        [span_25](start_span)<h2 id="topic1">Enzyme Classification and Structure[span_25](end_span)</h2>
        <p><strong>Enzymes</strong> are biological catalysts (usually proteins) that speed up biochemical reactions without being consumed. The molecule an enzyme acts upon is called the <strong>substrate</strong>.</p>

        [span_26](start_span)<h3>Classification and Nomenclature[span_26](end_span)</h3>
        <p>Enzymes are classified into <strong>six major classes</strong> by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) based on the type of reaction they catalyze. They often have the suffix "-ase".</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Oxidoreductases:</strong> Catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions (e.g., *dehydrogenase*, *oxidase*).</li>
            <li><strong>Transferases:</strong> Transfer a functional group (e.g., methyl, phosphate) from one molecule to another (e.g., *kinase*, *transaminase*).</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrolases:</strong> Break bonds by adding water (hydrolysis) (e.g., *lipase*, *amylase*, *peptidase*).</li>
            <li><strong>Lyases:</strong> Break bonds by means other than hydrolysis or oxidation, often forming a double bond (e.g., *decarboxylase*).</li>
            <li><strong>Isomerases:</strong> Catalyze the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule (isomerization) (e.g., *isomerase*, *mutase*).</li>
            <li><strong>Ligases:</strong> Join two molecules together, usually coupled with the hydrolysis of ATP (e.g., *DNA ligase*, *synthetase*).</li>
        </ol>
        
        [span_27](start_span)<h3>Prosthetic Groups, Cofactors of Enzyme[span_27](end_span)</h3>
        <p>Many enzymes require a non-protein component to be active.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apoenzyme:</strong> The inactive protein part of the enzyme.</li>
            <li><strong>Cofactor:</strong> The non-protein part. This is a broad term.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inorganic Ions:</strong> Metal ions that act as cofactors (e.g., $Mg^{2+}, Zn^{2+}, Fe^{2+}$).</li>
                    <li><strong>Coenzyme:</strong> An organic (non-protein) molecule that acts as a cofactor. Many vitamins are precursors to coenzymes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            [span_28](start_span)<li><strong>Prosthetic Group:</strong>[span_28](end_span) A coenzyme or metal ion that is <strong>tightly and covalently bound</strong> to the apoenzyme. (e.g., the heme group in hemoglobin).</li>
            <li><strong>Holoenzyme:</strong> The complete, active enzyme, consisting of the apoenzyme plus its cofactor/coenzyme.
                <br><blockquote><strong>Formula:</strong> Apoenzyme + Cofactor = Holoenzyme</blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        [span_29](start_span)<h2 id="topic2">Properties of Enzymes as Catalysts[span_29](end_span)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>High Catalytic Efficiency:</strong> They are extremely efficient, speeding up reactions by factors of $10^6$ to $10^{12}$.</li>
            <li><strong>High Specificity:</strong> Enzymes are highly specific for their substrate and the reaction they catalyze (e.G., *urease* only hydrolyzes *urea*).</li>
            <li><strong>Mild Conditions:</strong> They operate under mild conditions of temperature (e.g., 37Â°C) and pH (e.g., 7.4) found in living organisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Their activity can be controlled (activated or inhibited) by other molecules, allowing for metabolic regulation.</li>
        </ol>

        [span_30](start_span)<h3>Specific Activity[span_30](end_span)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A measure of enzyme purity. It is defined as the <strong>number of units of enzyme activity per milligram of total protein</strong>.
        </blockquote>
        <p>As an enzyme is purified, its specific activity increases (because the "units of activity" stay the same, but the "mg of protein" decreases as non-enzyme proteins are removed).</p>
        
        [span_31](start_span)<h3>Turn Over Number (TON)[span_31](end_span)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> The <strong>maximum number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time</strong> (usually per second).
        </blockquote>
        <p>It represents the catalytic efficiency of a single enzyme molecule when it is fully saturated with substrate. (Also known as $k_{cat}$).</p>
        
        [span_32](start_span)<h2 id="topic3">Mechanism of Enzyme Action[span_32](end_span)</h2>
        <p>Enzymes work by lowering the <strong>activation energy ($E_a$)</strong> of a reaction, thus making it proceed faster. They do this by providing an alternative reaction pathway via an <strong>enzyme-substrate complex (ES)</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Reaction:</strong> E (Enzyme) + S (Substrate) $\rightleftharpoons$ ES (Complex) $\rightarrow$ E (Enzyme) + P (Product)</p>

        [span_33](start_span)<h3>Lock and Key Model[span_33](end_span)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed by Emil Fischer in 1894.</li>
            <li><strong>Concept:</strong> The <strong>active site</strong> of the enzyme has a specific 3D shape that is perfectly complementary to the shape of the substrate.</li>
            <li>The substrate (the "key") fits perfectly into the rigid active site (the "lock").</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> This model is too rigid. It doesn't explain how enzymes can be flexible or how the transition state is stabilized.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Modern Context (Beyond Syllabus):</strong> The <strong>Induced Fit Model</strong> (by Daniel Koshland) is a more accepted model. It proposes that the active site is flexible. The binding of the substrate *induces* a change in the shape of the active site, leading to a perfect fit *after* binding, which helps to stabilize the transition state.
        </div>
        
        [span_34](start_span)<h2 id="topic4">Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity[span_34](end_span)</h2>
        <p>The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is influenced by several factors.</p>

        [span_35](start_span)<h3>Effect of pH[span_35](end_span)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Every enzyme has an <strong>optimum pH</strong> at which its activity is maximum (e.g., pepsin in the stomach, pH ~2; trypsin in the intestine, pH ~8).</li>
            <li><strong>At pH values above or below the optimum:</strong> The enzyme's activity decreases rapidly.</li>
            <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Extreme pH (highly acidic or basic) alters the ionization state of the amino acid residues in the active site and throughout the protein. This disrupts the enzyme's 3D structure (<strong>denaturation</strong>) and its ability to bind the substrate.</li>
        </ul>
        [span_36](start_span)<h3>Effect of Temperature[span_36](end_span)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Temperature:</strong> Reaction rate is low because molecules have low kinetic energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Increasing Temperature:</strong> As temperature rises, the reaction rate increases (more kinetic energy, more collisions), up to a certain point.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimum Temperature:</strong> The temperature at which the enzyme shows maximum activity (for most human enzymes, ~37-40Â°C).</li>
            <li><strong>High Temperature:</strong> Above the optimum, the rate drops sharply.</li>
            <li><strong>Reason:</strong> High temperatures provide too much thermal energy, which breaks the weak bonds (H-bonds, hydrophobic interactions) that maintain the enzyme's 3D structure. The enzyme unfolds and loses its active site shape. This is an irreversible process called <strong>denaturation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
