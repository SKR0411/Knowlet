        <h2 id="making">Making of the Indian Constitution, Salient Features and Philosophy</h2>

        <h3>Making of the Indian Constitution</h3>
        <p>The Constitution of India was not drafted overnight. It was the culmination of a long historical process and the hard work of the **Constituent Assembly**.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demand for a Constituent Assembly:</strong> The idea was first put forward by M.N. Roy in 1934 and was officially demanded by the Indian National Congress in 1935.</li>
            <li><strong>Formation:</strong> The Constituent Assembly was formed in 1946 under the **Cabinet Mission Plan**. Its members were elected indirectly by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies.</li>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Initially, it had 389 members, which was reduced to 299 after the partition of India. Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha was the temporary president, and later, **Dr. Rajendra Prasad** was elected as the permanent President.</li>
            <li><strong>Drafting Committee:</strong> The most important committee was the Drafting Committee, chaired by **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar**, who is rightly called the 'Father of the Indian Constitution'.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The Assembly took **2 years, 11 months, and 18 days** to complete its task. The Constitution was adopted on **November 26, 1949**, and came into full effect on **January 26, 1950**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Salient Features of the Constitution</h3>
        <p>The Indian Constitution is unique and draws from the best features of various other constitutions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lengthiest Written Constitution:</strong> It is the most detailed and comprehensive constitution in the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawn from Various Sources:</strong> It borrows heavily from other constitutions (e.g., Parliamentary system from the UK, Fundamental Rights from the USA, Directive Principles from Ireland).</li>
            <li><strong>Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility:</strong> Some provisions can be amended by a simple majority, while others require a special majority, making it neither too rigid nor too flexible.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal System with Unitary Bias:</strong> It establishes a federal structure (two governments, division of powers) but with a strong central government.</li>
            <li><strong>Parliamentary Form of Government:</strong> The executive is responsible to the legislature.</li>
            <li><strong>Secular State:</strong> The state does not have an official religion and treats all religions equally.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Adult Franchise:</strong> Every citizen above 18 years has the right to vote without any discrimination.</li>
            <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> A hierarchical and independent judicial system to protect the rule of law and fundamental rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Fundamental Rights, Duties, and Directive Principles:</strong> A comprehensive charter of rights and duties for citizens and directives for the state.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Philosophy of the Constitution</h3>
        <p>The philosophy is best reflected in the **Preamble** to the Constitution. The Preamble declares India to be a **Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, and Democratic Republic** and aims to secure for all its citizens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Social, Economic, and Political.</li>
            <li><strong>Liberty:</strong> of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship.</li>
            <li><strong>Equality:</strong> of status and of opportunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraternity:</strong> assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember the keywords of the Preamble in order: **Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic**. The terms 'Socialist' and 'Secular' were added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.

        <h2 id="rights-duties">Fundamental Rights and Duties, Directive Principles of State Policy</h2>

        <h3>Fundamental Rights (Part III, Articles 12-35)</h3>
        <p>These are basic human rights guaranteed to all citizens. They are **justiciable**, meaning one can go to court if they are violated.</p>
        <p>There are six fundamental rights:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Right to Equality (Articles 14-18):</strong> Equality before law, prohibition of discrimination, and equality of opportunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22):</strong> Freedom of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.</li>
            <li><strong>Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24):</strong> Prohibits human trafficking, forced labor, and child labor.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25-28):</strong> Freedom of conscience and the right to practice, profess, and propagate religion.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29-30):</strong> Protects the interests of minorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32):</strong> The right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of rights. Dr. Ambedkar called it the "heart and soul" of the Constitution.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) (Part IV, Articles 36-51)</h3>
        <p>These are ideals that the state should keep in mind while formulating policies and enacting laws. They are **non-justiciable**, meaning they are not enforceable by courts.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> To establish a social and economic democracy—a **welfare state**.
        </blockquote>
        <p>They are broadly classified into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Socialist Principles:</strong> e.g., to secure a living wage, promote equal justice and free legal aid.</li>
            <li><strong>Gandhian Principles:</strong> e.g., to organize village panchayats, prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks.</li>
            <li><strong>Liberal-Intellectual Principles:</strong> e.g., to secure a uniform civil code, protect monuments of national importance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fundamental Duties (Part IVA, Article 51-A)</h3>
        <p>Added by the **42nd Amendment in 1976** on the recommendation of the **Swaran Singh Committee**. Like DPSPs, they are **non-justiciable**.</p>
        <p>There are 11 fundamental duties, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions.</li>
            <li>To cherish the noble ideals of the freedom struggle.</li>
            <li>To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.</li>
            <li>To defend the country and render national service.</li>
            <li>To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood.</li>
            <li>To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>⚠️ Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not confuse Fundamental Rights, DPSPs, and Fundamental Duties. Know which part of the Constitution they are in and whether they are justiciable or not.
