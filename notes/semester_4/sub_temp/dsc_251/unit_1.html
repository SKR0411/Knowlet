    <section id="characteristics">
        <h2>1. Characteristics of the UK Constitution</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>The Constitution of the United Kingdom is unique because it is not contained in a single document[cite: 634]. [cite_start]It has evolved over centuries through a combination of statutes, conventions, and judicial decisions[cite: 634].</p>
        
        <h3>Uncodified Nature</h3>
        <p>Unlike the US or Indian constitutions, the UK constitution is <strong>uncodified</strong>. [cite_start]This means there is no supreme document that holds higher legal status than regular Acts of Parliament[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Evolutionary Growth</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The British political system is the result of gradual historical development rather than a revolutionary break from the past[cite: 634]. [cite_start]It has transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a <strong>constitutional monarchy</strong> and a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong>[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Unitary State</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The UK is a <strong>unitary state</strong>, where supreme power resides with the central Parliament at Westminster[cite: 634]. [cite_start]While there has been significant devolution of power to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, legal sovereignty remains centralized[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Parliamentary Sovereignty</h3>
        <p>This is the cornerstone of the British Constitution. [cite_start]It implies that Parliament can make or unmake any law, and no person or body is recognized by the law as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament[cite: 634, 635].</p>
        
        <h3>Rule of Law</h3>
        <p>The constitution is governed by the principle that every citizen is subject to the law, including lawmakers themselves. [cite_start]This ensures that the exercise of arbitrary power is prevented[cite: 634].</p>
    </section>

    <section id="the-crown">
        <h2>2. The Crown: Powers and Functions</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>In the UK, a distinction is made between the <strong>Monarch</strong> (the individual) and <strong>The Crown</strong> (the institution)[cite: 634]. [cite_start]The Crown represents the sum total of governmental powers and is the symbolic head of the executive, legislature, and judiciary[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Constitutional Monarchy</h3>
        <p>The UK is a <strong>Constitutional Monarchy</strong>. [cite_start]This means the Monarch "reigns but does not rule"[cite: 634]. [cite_start]The actual exercise of power is carried out by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet in the name of the Crown[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Executive Powers</h3>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>Appointment of the Prime Minister and other ministers[cite: 634].</li>
            [cite_start]<li>Granting of Royal Assent to bills passed by Parliament to make them law[cite: 634].</li>
            [cite_start]<li>Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces[cite: 634].</li>
            [cite_start]<li>Representing the nation in international relations and signing treaties[cite: 634].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legislative and Judicial Role</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The Monarch summons, prorogues, and dissolves Parliament[cite: 634]. [cite_start]Judicially, the Monarch is the "fountain of justice," although justice is administered by independent courts[cite: 634].</p>

        <blockquote>
            Formula: The King/Queen can do no wrong (Legal maxim implying the Monarch acts only on advice).
        </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section id="the-pm">
        <h2>3. The Prime Minister: Role and Functions</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>The Prime Minister (PM) is the <strong>real executive head</strong> of the UK government[cite: 634]. [cite_start]The office is based largely on constitutional convention rather than law[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Appointment and Position</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The Monarch appoints the leader of the party that has a majority in the House of Commons as the PM[cite: 634]. [cite_start]The PM is the "keystone of the Cabinet arch"[cite: 634].</p>

        <h3>Main Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Formation of the Cabinet:</strong> The PM selects ministers and has the power to dismiss them[cite: 634].</li>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Presiding over Cabinet:</strong> The PM coordinates the policies and activities of various government departments[cite: 634].</li>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Leader of the House of Commons:</strong> The PM acts as the primary spokesperson for the government in Parliament[cite: 634].</li>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Link between the Crown and Parliament:</strong> The PM keeps the Monarch informed about government affairs[cite: 634].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Powers of Patronage</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The PM recommends the appointment of senior judges, bishops, and life peers to the Monarch, giving the PM significant influence over various national institutions[cite: 634].</p>
    </section>

    <section id="the-parliament">
        <h2>4. The Parliament: Structure and Powers</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>The UK Parliament is a <strong>bicameral legislature</strong>, consisting of two houses: the House of Commons and the House of Lords[cite: 635].</p>

        <h3>House of Commons</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The <strong>House of Commons</strong> is the lower house but the most powerful one[cite: 635]. [cite_start]It consists of 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) elected by the people[cite: 635].</p>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>Controls the national finances (The "Power of the Purse")[cite: 635].</li>
            [cite_start]<li>Holds the government accountable through questioning and debates[cite: 635].</li>
            [cite_start]<li>Can force the government to resign through a <em>Vote of No Confidence</em>[cite: 635].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>House of Lords</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The <strong>House of Lords</strong> is the upper house[cite: 635]. [cite_start]It consists of life peers, hereditary peers, and bishops[cite: 635].</p>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>Acts as a revising chamber to review and suggest amendments to legislation[cite: 635].</li>
            [cite_start]<li>Can delay non-money bills for up to one year but cannot block them permanently[cite: 635].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Legislative Process</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>For a bill to become an Act, it must pass through several stages in both houses (First Reading, Second Reading, Committee Stage, Report Stage, Third Reading) and receive Royal Assent[cite: 634, 635].</p>

        <h2>5. Exam-Oriented Preparation</h2>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand Conventions:</strong> Many aspects of the UK system (like the PM's powers) are not written in law. Use the word "Convention" frequently in your answers.</li>
                <li><strong>Bicameralism:</strong> Be ready to explain the relationship between the two houses and why the House of Commons is more powerful.</li>
                <li><strong>Parliamentary Sovereignty:</strong> This is a favorite exam topic. Memorize the definition given by A.V. Dicey.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-section">
            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not say the Monarch has no power. They have "latent" powers that are exercised on advice.</li>
                <li>Do not confuse the "Monarch" with the "Crown." The Crown is a permanent institution, while the Monarch is a person.</li>
                <li>Avoid saying the UK has no constitution. It has an <em>uncodified</em> one, not <em>none</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the "Royal Prerogative"?</strong></p>
            <p>A: These are powers historically held by the Monarch that are now exercised by the government, such as declaring war or issuing passports.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Can the House of Lords stop a tax bill?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. Under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the House of Lords has no power to block "Money Bills."</p>
