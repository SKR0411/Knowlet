        <h2>1. Meaning and Evolution of International Politics</h2>
        <p>International Politics is the study of the interaction between sovereign states and other entities in the global arena. It focuses on how these actors pursue their interests, exercise power, and engage in cooperation or conflict.</p>

        <h3>Meaning</h3>
        <p>At its core, International Politics is a process of <strong>interaction</strong>. While traditionally centered on states, modern definitions include the role of international organizations and non-state groups. It is often described as the "struggle for power" among nations, a concept popularized by classical realists like Hans Morgenthau.</p>

        <h3>Evolution</h3>
        <p>The field has evolved significantly from a narrow focus on diplomatic history to a complex social science:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-WWI:</strong> Dominated by the study of diplomatic history and international law.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-WWI:</strong> Focus shifted to "Idealism," emphasizing international organizations like the League of Nations to prevent war.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-WWII:</strong> The rise of "Realism" occurred, focusing on national interest and power politics during the Cold War.</li>
            <li><strong>Contemporary Era:</strong> Includes globalization, environmental issues, and the massive influence of non-state actors.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="nature-ip">
        <h2>2. Nature of International Politics</h2>
        <p>The nature of International Politics is dynamic and multi-faceted, characterized by several key elements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sovereign States as Primary Actors:</strong> Traditionally, states have been the main players, possessing the highest authority within their territories.</li>
            <li><strong>Power-Centric:</strong> Power is both the means and the end in international relations. Actors use military, economic, and soft power to achieve their goals.</li>
            <li><strong>National Interest:</strong> This is the fundamental objective of every state. Policies are designed to protect and promote the well-being of the nation-state.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Process:</strong> It is not a static state but a constant process of adjustment and re-adjustment among actors.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict and Cooperation:</strong> The international arena is a mix of both. While states compete for resources (conflict), they also form alliances and trade agreements (cooperation).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-ip">
        <h2>3. Scope of International Politics</h2>
        <p>The scope of International Politics has widened over time to include almost all aspects of human life that transcend national borders.</p>

        <h3>Core Areas of Study</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State Systems:</strong> Analysis of how states behave and relate to one another.</li>
            <li><strong>International Organizations:</strong> Study of the UN, WTO, IMF, and regional groups like SAARC or ASEAN.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign Policy:</strong> The determinants and objectives that guide a country's behavior abroad.</li>
            <li><strong>War and Peace:</strong> Causes of conflict, methods of conflict resolution, and peacebuilding.</li>
            <li><strong>International Economy:</strong> Globalization, trade, and the influence of multinational corporations.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Issues:</strong> Climate change, human rights, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </section>

    <section id="non-state-actors">
        <h2>4. Emergence of Non-State Actors</h2>
        <p>A major shift in modern International Politics is the <strong>emergence of non-state actors</strong>. These are entities other than sovereign states that exert significant influence on global affairs.</p>

        <h3>Types of Non-State Actors</h3>
        <div class="add-horizontal-scroll">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>IGOs</strong></td>
                <td>Intergovernmental Organizations formed by states.</td>
                <td>UN, EU, NATO </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>NGOs</strong></td>
                <td>Non-Governmental Organizations acting independently of governments.</td>
                <td>Greenpeace, Amnesty International </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>MNCs</strong></td>
                <td>Multinational Corporations with operations in multiple countries.</td>
                <td>Apple, Google, Reliance </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Transnational Groups</strong></td>
                <td>Groups that cross borders, sometimes for illegal purposes.</td>
                <td>Terrorist networks, organized crime </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Impact of Non-State Actors</h3>
        <p>They challenge the traditional state-centric view (Westphalian system) by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Influencing international law and norms.</li>
            <li>Controlling massive economic resources (MNCs).</li>
            <li>Providing humanitarian aid where states fail (NGOs).</li>
            <li>Setting the global agenda on environmental and human rights issues.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Define Power:</strong> In any question about the nature of International Politics, clearly define "Power" as the ability to influence others.</li>
                <li><strong>Trace Evolution:</strong> If asked about evolution, mention the shift from "Idealism" to "Realism" to "Pluralism".</li>
                <li><strong>Non-State Actors:</strong> Use recent examples (like the role of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation or tech giants) to show current understanding.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-section">
            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Non-State Actors:</strong> Do not treat states as the <em>only</em> actors in the modern world.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusing IP with IR:</strong> While often used interchangeably, International Politics (IP) is strictly about the "political" and power-related aspects, whereas International Relations (IR) is broader (including culture, sports, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
