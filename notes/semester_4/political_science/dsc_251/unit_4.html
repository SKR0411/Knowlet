        <span id="spap_chinaFeatures"><h2>1. Basic Characteristics of the Constitution</h2></span>
        <p>The People's Republic of China (PRC) operates under a socialist constitutional framework that defines it as a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship.</p>
        
        <h3>Core Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unitary System:</strong> China is a unitary multinational state where power is centralized in the national government.</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership of the CPC:</strong> The Constitution recognizes the "leading role" of the Communist Party of China in every aspect of state governance.</li>
            <li><strong>Socialist Market Economy:</strong> The state manages the economy while allowing for market mechanisms under socialist principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Democratic Centralism:</strong> This is the guiding organizational principle where members are free to discuss but must follow the majority and higher leadership once a decision is made.</li>
            <li><strong>Written and Flexible:</strong> While written, the constitution can be amended relatively easily by the National People's Congress to reflect changing political environments.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="china-npc">
        <span id="spap_chinaNPC"><h2>2. National People's Congress (NPC)</h2></span>
        <p>The <strong>National People's Congress</strong> is defined as the highest organ of state power in China.</p>

        <h3>Composition and Role</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unicameralism:</strong> Unlike the UK or US, China has a single legislative chamber.</li>
            <li><strong>Representation:</strong> It is composed of deputies elected from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the armed forces.</li>
            <li><strong>Term:</strong> Deputies serve for a term of five years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main Powers</h3>

        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="china-standing-committee">
        <span id="spap_chinaSC"><h2>3. The Standing Committee</h2></span>
        <p>The <strong>Standing Committee</strong> is the permanent body of the NPC that exercises legislative power when the NPC is not in session.</p>

        <span id="spap_chinaStateCouncil"><h2>4. The State Council</h2></span>
        <p>The <strong>State Council</strong> is the Central People's Government and serves as the highest executive organ of state power.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="china-communist-party">
        <span id="spap_chinaCPC"><h2>5. The Communist Party of China (CPC)</h2></span>
        <p>The <strong>Communist Party of China</strong> is the true center of political power in the country, despite the formal structure of the state organs.</p>

        <h3>Role in Governance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Making:</strong> Major national policies are decided within the Party's organs (like the Politburo) before being formally adopted by the state legislature.</li>
            <li><strong>Personnel Control:</strong> The Party controls all major appointments in the state apparatus, military, and state-owned enterprises.</li>
            <li><strong>Intertwined Structure:</strong> Key leaders often hold positions in both the Party and the State (e.g., the General Secretary of the CPC is usually the President of the PRC).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand the Dual Structure:</strong> Always explain that for every state institution, there is a parallel Party institution that guides it.</li>
                <li><strong>Democratic Centralism:</strong> This is a favorite exam topic. Be sure to define it as "freedom of discussion, unity of action".</li>
                <li><strong>The Standing Committee:</strong> Emphasize that because the NPC is so large and meets rarely, the Standing Committee is where the actual day-to-day power lies.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-section">
            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not confuse the "Premier" (Head of Government) with the "President" (Head of State).</li>
                <li>Avoid describing China as a "Separation of Powers" system; it explicitly rejects that model in favor of "Unity of Powers" under the NPC.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-section">
