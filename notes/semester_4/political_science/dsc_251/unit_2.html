        <h2>1. Basic Features of the US Constitution</h2>
        <p>The US Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. It serves as the foundation for its political and legal systems.</p>

        <h3>Written and Rigid Constitution</h3>
        <p>The US Constitution is a <strong>written</strong> document. It is also <strong>rigid</strong>, meaning the process to amend it is intentionally difficult to ensure stability and protect the rights of states.</p>

        <h3>Federalism</h3>
        <p>The US operates under a <strong>federal system</strong>, where power is divided between the national (central) government and individual state governments.</p>

        <h3>Separation of Powers</h3>
        <p>This principle ensures that the legislative, executive, and judicial functions are held by different branches to prevent the concentration of power.</p>

        <h3>Checks and Balances</h3>
        <p>Each branch has the power to limit the actions of the others. For example, the President can veto legislation passed by Congress, while Congress can override a veto.</p>

        <h3>Bill of Rights</h3>
        <p>The first ten amendments, known as the <strong>Bill of Rights</strong>, guarantee fundamental individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religion.</p>

            <li><strong>Commander-in-Chief:</strong> Holds supreme command over the US military.</li>

            <li><strong>Power of Appointment:</strong> Appoints Cabinet members, ambassadors, and federal judges, subject to Senate approval.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legislative and Diplomatic Roles</h3>

            <li><strong>Veto Power:</strong> Can reject bills passed by Congress.</li>
