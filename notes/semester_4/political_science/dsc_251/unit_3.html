    <section id="swiss-features">
        <span id="spap_features"><h2>1. Salient Features of the Swiss Constitution</h2></span>
        <p>The Swiss Constitution is unique because it blends federalism, republicanism, and direct democracy into a stable political system.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Written and Rigid:</strong> It is a written document that requires a special procedure for amendments, involving both the people and the Cantons.</li>
            <li><strong>Republicanism:</strong> Switzerland is a republic where there is no hereditary monarch; all authorities are elected.</li>
            <li><strong>Federalism:</strong> Power is shared between the Confederation (Central) and the Cantons (States). The Cantons possess all powers not specifically granted to the federal government.</li>
            <li><strong>Permanent Neutrality:</strong> Switzerland maintains a policy of not participating in armed conflicts between other states, which is recognized internationally.</li>
            <li><strong>Plural Executive:</strong> Unlike the UK or US, executive power is shared equally among seven members.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="direct-democracy">
        <span id="spap_democracy"><h2>2. Direct Democracy in Switzerland</h2></span>
        <p>Switzerland is often called the "home of direct democracy" because citizens play a direct role in decision-making through specific instruments.</p>

        <h3>Instruments of Direct Democracy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Referendum:</strong> Citizens can vote on laws passed by the legislature. It can be <em>mandatory</em> (for constitutional changes) or <em>optional</em> (demanded by 50,000 citizens for regular laws).</li>
            <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> This allows 100,000 citizens to propose a specific amendment to the Federal Constitution.</li>
            <li><strong>Landsgemeinde:</strong> In some smaller Cantons, citizens meet in an open-air assembly to vote on local laws and elect officials by a show of hands.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

    <section id="federal-executive">
        <span id="spap_executive"><h2>3. The Federal Executive (Federal Council)</h2></span>
        <p>The <strong>Federal Council</strong> is the executive head of Switzerland, but it functions very differently from the British Cabinet or the US President.</p>

        <h3>Composition and Nature</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plural Body:</strong> It consists of <strong>seven members</strong> elected by the Federal Assembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Equality:</strong> All members are equal. There is no "Prime Minister" with superior powers.</li>
            <li><strong>President of the Confederation:</strong> One of the seven is chosen to act as President for <em>one year only</em>. The role is largely ceremonial and rotates annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Stability:</strong> It is a non-partisan body where members are chosen from major political parties to work together (collegiality).</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="federal-legislature">
        <span id="spap_legislature"><h2>4. The Federal Legislature (Federal Assembly)</h2></span>
        <p>The <strong>Federal Assembly</strong> is the bicameral legislature of Switzerland.</p>

        <h3>The Two Houses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>National Council (Lower House):</strong> Represents the Swiss people. It consists of 200 members elected based on the population of each Canton.</li>
            <li><strong>Council of States (Upper House):</strong> Represents the Cantons. Each full Canton sends 2 members, and each half-Canton sends 1, totaling 46 members.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>Powers</h3>
        <p>The two houses have <strong>equal powers</strong>. A law must be approved by both houses to pass. They jointly elect the Federal Council and federal judges.</p>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Use terms like "Plural Executive," "Collegiality," and "Direct Democracy" to score higher.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Be ready to explain why the Swiss President is weaker than the US President.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Majority:</strong> Remember that constitutional changes need a majority of the <em>people</em> AND a majority of the <em>Cantons</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-section">
            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not call the Swiss President the "real ruler." They are just the "first among equals" for one year.</li>
                <li>Avoid confusing the "Referendum" (checking a law) with the "Initiative" (proposing a new law).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Is Switzerland a Parliamentary or Presidential system?</strong></p>
            <p>A: It is a unique <strong>Plural Executive</strong> system that combines features of both but is distinct from either.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What is a "half-Canton"?</strong></p>
            <p>A: These are smaller cantons that arose from historical splits; they have the same internal rights but only one seat in the Council of States.</p>
