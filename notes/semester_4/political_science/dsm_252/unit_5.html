            <h2>1. Political Institutions at the Local Level</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Local government is the <strong>third tier</strong> of the Indian political system, established to ensure democratic decentralization and power-sharing at the grassroots level. It allows people to participate directly in the administration of their own locality, addressing problems that are often neglected by central or state governments.</p>
        
        <h3>Importance of Local Government</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grassroots Democracy:</strong> It brings government closer to the people.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Solutions:</strong> Local issues are best understood and solved by local representatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> It reduces the burden on state and central administrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership Development:</strong> It serves as a training ground for future political leaders.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>2. Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI)</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The Panchayati Raj system was constitutionalized through the <strong>73rd Amendment Act, 1992</strong>. It is the system of local self-government in <em>rural areas</em>.</p>

        <h3>Three-Tier Structure</h3>
        <p>The system follows a uniform three-tier structure across most of the country:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gram Panchayat:</strong> At the village level. It is the executive body of the village.</li>
            <li><strong>Panchayat Samiti:</strong> At the intermediate or block level. It acts as a link between the village and the district.</li>
            <li><strong>Zila Parishad:</strong> At the district level. It is the apex body of the system.</li>
        </ol>

        

        <h3>The Gram Sabha</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Gram Sabha</strong> is the foundation of the Panchayati Raj system. It consists of all registered voters in the area of a panchayat and serves as the only permanent body in the system.</p>

        <h3>Salient Features of the 73rd Amendment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reservation:</strong> Mandatory 1/3rd of seats for women; seats for SCs and STs in proportion to their population.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> A fixed term of 5 years. If dissolved earlier, elections must be held within 6 months.</li>
            <li><strong>State Election Commission:</strong> A separate body to conduct independent and fair panchayat elections.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance Commission:</strong> Appointed every 5 years to review the financial position of panchayats and recommend tax distribution.</li>

            <h2>3. Urban Local Bodies (ULB)</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The <strong>74th Amendment Act, 1992</strong> provides the constitutional framework for urban local government.</p>

        <h3>Types of Municipalities</h3>
        <p>The Act provides for three types of municipalities depending on the size and nature of the urban area:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nagar Panchayat:</strong> For areas in transition from a rural to an urban area.</li>
            <li><strong>Municipal Council:</strong> For smaller urban areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Municipal Corporation:</strong> For larger urban areas (metropolitan cities).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wards Committee:</strong> For municipalities with a population of 3 lakhs or more.</li>
            <li><strong>12th Schedule:</strong> Contains 18 functional items (like urban planning, water supply, and public health) that fall under the jurisdiction of ULBs.</li>
            <li><strong>District Planning Committee:</strong> To consolidate the plans prepared by panchayats and municipalities in the district.</li>

            <h2>4. The 6th Schedule of the Indian Constitution</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The 6th Schedule provides for the administration of <strong>tribal areas</strong> in the four North-Eastern states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.</p>

        <h3>Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)</h3>
        <p>Unlike the general administrative setup, these tribal areas are governed through <strong>Autonomous District Councils</strong>. These councils possess significant legislative, judicial, executive, and financial powers.</p>

        <h3>Key Powers of ADCs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legislation:</strong> They can make laws on subjects like land, forests, marriage, inheritance, and social customs.</li>
            <li><strong>Justice:</strong> They can constitute village councils or courts for trials of suits between ST members.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> They have the power to collect land revenue and taxes on professions and trades.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            "The 6th Schedule acts as a 'State within a State', providing tribal communities with a high degree of autonomy to protect their culture and identity."
        </blockquote>

            <h2>5. Administration of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong</h2>
        </span>
        <p>In Assam, the hill districts of <strong>Dima Hasao</strong> (formerly North Cachar Hills) and <strong>Karbi Anglong</strong> are governed under the provisions of the 6th Schedule.</p>

        <h3>Specific Councils</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council (NCHAC):</strong> Administers Dima Hasao district.</li>
            <li><strong>Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC):</strong> Administers Karbi Anglong district.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Administrative Significance</h3>
        <p>These councils ensure that the administration remains sensitive to the specific needs of the hill tribes. They operate independently of the general Panchayati Raj system of the state, maintaining their own legislative and administrative machinery to protect tribal land and customs.</p>

            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amendment Numbers:</strong> Always link PRI with the 73rd and ULB with the 74th Amendment.</li>
                <li><strong>The 6th Schedule List:</strong> Remember the four states using the mnemonic <strong>AMTM</strong> (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram).</li>
                <li><strong>District Specifics:</strong> When writing about the 6th Schedule in an Assam University exam, you MUST mention <strong>Dima Hasao</strong> and <strong>Karbi Anglong</strong> as required by the syllabus.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse the 5th Schedule (tribal areas in the rest of India) with the <strong>6th Schedule</strong> (specifically for parts of NE India). The 6th Schedule grants much higher autonomy through District Councils.

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the minimum age to contest local body elections?</strong><br>
            A: 21 years (unlike 25 for Lok Sabha).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Does the 73rd Amendment apply to 6th Schedule areas?</strong><br>
            A: No. Tribal areas in the 6th Schedule states are exempted from the general Panchayati Raj system because they have their own Councils.</p>
