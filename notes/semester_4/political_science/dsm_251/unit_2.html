            <h2>1. Nature of Federalism in India</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Federalism in India is a unique system that does not strictly follow the traditional model of federalism seen in the United States. Instead, it is often described as a <strong>"Federation with a strong centralizing tendency"</strong> or a <strong>"Quasi-federal"</strong> system.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Two-Tier Government:</strong> Power is divided between the Union (Central) government and the State governments.</li>
            <li><strong>Written Constitution:</strong> The division of powers is clearly specified in a supreme, written document.</li>
            <li><strong>Division of Powers:</strong> Responsibilities are divided into the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List (under the Seventh Schedule).</li>
            <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> The Supreme Court acts as the arbiter in disputes between the Union and States.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unitary Features (Central Bias)</h3>
        <p>Despite being federal, the Indian Constitution contains several unitary features that empower the Center over the States:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single Citizenship:</strong> Unlike the US, India has only national citizenship.</li>
            <li><strong>Appointment of Governors:</strong> The President appoints State Governors who act as agents of the Center.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Provisions:</strong> During an emergency, the federal structure can transform into a unitary one.</li>
            <li><strong>All-India Services:</strong> Officers (IAS, IPS) are recruited by the Center but serve in the States.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            "The Indian Constitution is federal in form but unitary in spirit." — K.C. Wheare
        </blockquote>

            <h2>2. Union-State Relations</h2>
        </span> 
        <p>The relationship between the Center and the States is categorized into three main areas to ensure smooth governance and cooperation.</p>

        <h3>A. Legislative Relations (Articles 245–255)</h3>
        <p>Parliament has the power to make laws for the whole country, while State legislatures make laws for their respective states. In case of a conflict in the <strong>Concurrent List</strong>, the Central law usually prevails.</p>

        <h3>B. Administrative Relations (Articles 256–263)</h3>
        <p>States are expected to exercise their executive power in a way that ensures compliance with Central laws. The Center can issue directions to States on specific matters, such as the maintenance of communication means of national importance.</p>

        <h3>C. Financial Relations (Articles 264–293)</h3>
        <p>This is the most critical area of conflict. The Center has more lucrative sources of revenue (like Income Tax and Customs), while States have heavy expenditure responsibilities (like Health and Education). The <strong>Finance Commission</strong> is appointed every five years to recommend the distribution of taxes between the Center and the States.</p>

    <div class="content-block" id="sarkaria_commission">
        <span id="spap_sarkaria">
            <h2>3. Sarkaria Commission</h2>
        </span> 
        <p>Set up in <strong>1983</strong> under Justice R.S. Sarkaria, this commission was tasked with reviewing the working of the existing arrangements between the Union and the States.</p>

        <h3>Major Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Article 356:</strong> Recommended that President's Rule should be used very sparingly and only as a last resort.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Governor:</strong> The Governor should be an eminent person from outside the state and not be a member of the ruling party.</li>
            <li><strong>Inter-State Council:</strong> Suggested the permanent establishment of an Inter-State Council to promote cooperation (established in 1990).</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrent List:</strong> The Center should consult States before legislating on items in the Concurrent List.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block" id="punchhi_commission">
        <span id="spap_punchhi">
            <h2>4. Punchhi Commission</h2>
        </span> 
        <p>Appointed in <strong>2007</strong> under Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi, it was the second commission on Center-State relations, focusing on changes that occurred since the Sarkaria Commission.</p>

        <h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Tenure for Governors:</strong> Governors should have a fixed term of five years and their removal should not be at the Center's whim.</li>
            <li><strong>Impeachment of Governors:</strong> Suggested a process similar to the President's impeachment for removing Governors.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Security:</strong> Recommended the creation of a dedicated task force to handle internal security threats without infringing on state autonomy.</li>
            <li><strong>Localized Emergency:</strong> Suggested that Article 355/356 could be applied to a specific district or area rather than the entire state.</li>
        </ul>

        </span>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Define 'Quasi-federal':</strong> Use this term and cite <em>K.C. Wheare</em> to show advanced knowledge of the nature of Indian federalism.</li>
                <li><strong>List Comparison:</strong> Be ready to explain the difference between the Union, State, and Concurrent lists.</li>
                <li><strong>Commissions:</strong> Remember the years (Sarkaria-1983, Punchhi-2007) as they are often asked in objective questions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not say India is a "true federation" like the USA. Always mention the <strong>"Unitary Bias"</strong> or the <strong>"strong center"</strong>.

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is Article 356?</strong><br>
            A: It allows the President to take over the administration of a state (President's Rule) if the state government cannot function according to the Constitution.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Why is the Finance Commission important?</strong><br>
            A: It ensures vertical and horizontal equity in tax distribution, helping bridge the gap between Central revenue and State expenditure.</p>

        <h3>Mnemonics for Federal Features</h3>
        <p><strong>D-U-A-L:</strong> <strong>D</strong>ivision of powers, <strong>U</strong>nique written constitution, <strong>A</strong>rbiter (Independent Judiciary), <strong>L</strong>egislative supremacy (of Constitution).</p>
