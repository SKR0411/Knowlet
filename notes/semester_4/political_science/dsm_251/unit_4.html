            <h2>1. The Parliament of India: Composition</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The Union Legislature of India is known as the <strong>Parliament</strong>. It is a bicameral body, meaning it consists of two houses, along with the President of India.</p>
        
        <h3>The Two Houses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rajya Sabha (Council of States):</strong> The Upper House. It represents the States and Union Territories of India. It has a maximum strength of 250 members, of which 12 are nominated by the President for their expertise in art, literature, science, or social service. It is a permanent house and cannot be dissolved; members serve for 6 years, with one-third retiring every two years.</li>
            <li><strong>Lok Sabha (House of the People):</strong> The Lower House. It represents the people of India as a whole. Members are directly elected by the people on the basis of universal adult franchise. The maximum strength is currently 552. Its normal term is 5 years, but it can be dissolved earlier by the President.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-focus">
            <h3>Exam Tip</h3>
            <p>Remember that the President is technically a part of the Parliament although they do not sit in either House, because no bill can become law without the President's assent.</p>

            <h2>4. The Supreme Court: Composition and Appointment</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The <strong>Supreme Court of India</strong> is the highest judicial forum and the final court of appeal under the Constitution of India.</p>

        <h3>Composition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Supreme Court consists of the <strong>Chief Justice of India (CJI)</strong> and other judges.</li>
            <li>The number of judges is determined by the Parliament. Currently, the sanctioned strength is 34 (including the CJI).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Appointment and Qualifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appointment:</strong> Every judge is appointed by the <strong>President</strong>. The President usually acts based on the recommendation of a 'Collegium' of senior judges.</li>
            <li><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Must be a citizen of India; and must have been a judge of a High Court for 5 years OR an advocate of a High Court for 10 years OR a distinguished jurist in the opinion of the President.</li>

            <h2>5. Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is vast and can be divided into several categories:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Original Jurisdiction:</strong> Power to hear cases for the first time, specifically disputes between the Union and States or between two or more States.</li>
            <li><strong>Appellate Jurisdiction:</strong> Power to hear appeals against the judgments of High Courts in civil, criminal, and constitutional matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Advisory Jurisdiction:</strong> The President can seek the opinion of the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact of public importance (Art. 143).</li>
            <li><strong>Writ Jurisdiction:</strong> Power to issue writs (like Habeas Corpus, Mandamus) for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights (Art. 32).</li>

            <h2>6. Judicial Review and Judicial Activism</h2>
        </span>
        <p>These two concepts define the power of the Indian Judiciary to protect the Constitution and the rights of citizens.</p>

        <h3>Judicial Review</h3>
        <p>It is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders. If a law is found to violate the Constitution, the Court can declare it <strong>null and void</strong>. This ensures that the Constitution remains the supreme law of the land.</p>

        <h3>Judicial Activism</h3>
        <p>It refers to the proactive role played by the judiciary in protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring justice when the legislature or executive fails to act. It often manifests through <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong>, where any citizen can approach the court on behalf of a marginalized group.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse 'Judicial Review' with 'Judicial Activism'. Review is a <em>legal power</em> based on the text of the Constitution, while Activism is a <em>philosophy</em> or style of functioning of the judges.

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Why is the Rajya Sabha called a 'Permanent House'?</strong><br>

            <p><strong>Q: What is the 'Basic Structure Doctrine'?</strong><br>
            A: Established in the <em>Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)</em>, it states that Parliament cannot amend certain fundamental features of the Constitution using its power of amendment.</p>
