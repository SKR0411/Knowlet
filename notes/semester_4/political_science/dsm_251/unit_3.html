            <h2>1. The President: Election and Impeachment</h2> 
        </span>
        <p>The President of India is the <strong>Head of State</strong> and the first citizen of India. The office is a position of great dignity and authority, although the actual executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers.</p>
        
        <h3>Election Procedure</h3>
        <p>The President is not elected directly by the people but through an <strong>Electoral College</strong>.  This college consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The elected members of both Houses of Parliament. </li>
            <li>The elected members of the Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabhas) of all States. </li>
            <li>The elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of Union Territories (Delhi and Puducherry).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The election is held in accordance with the system of <strong>proportional representation</strong> by means of the <strong>single transferable vote</strong>. </p>

        <h3>Impeachment Procedure</h3> 
        <p>The President can be removed from office before the expiry of the term only by <strong>impeachment</strong> for "violation of the Constitution." </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The charge can be initiated by either House of Parliament.</li>
            <li>It must be signed by at least 1/4th of the members of that House.</li>
            <li>A 14-day notice is given to the President.</li>
            <li>The resolution must be passed by a majority of not less than <strong>two-thirds of the total membership</strong> of the House.</li>
            <li>The other House then investigates the charges. If it also passes the resolution with a 2/3rd majority, the President stands removed.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exam-focus">
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the 'Single Transferable Vote'?</strong><br>
            A: It is a system where voters rank candidates by preference. If no candidate gets a majority of first-preference votes, the votes of the lowest-ranked candidate are transferred based on subsequent preferences.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Can the President act independently?</strong><br>
            A: Generally, no. Under Article 74, the President <em>must</em> act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. However, the President can ask the Council to reconsider its advice once.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse the "Council of Ministers" with the "Cabinet." The Cabinet is a smaller, more powerful inner circle within the larger Council.
