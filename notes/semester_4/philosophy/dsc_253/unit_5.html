        <h2>Justice</h2>
        <p><strong>Justice</strong> is a core concern of social and political philosophy, dealing with the fair treatment of individuals and the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Dimensions of Justice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distributive Justice:</strong> Concerns the fair allocation of goods and wealth in a society.</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural Justice:</strong> Focuses on the fairness of the processes and rules that determine outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Aims for a society that provides for the basic needs and rights of all its members, regardless of their social standing.</li>
        </ul>
    </span>

    <span id="spap_liberty">
        <h2>Liberty</h2>
        <p><strong>Liberty</strong> refers to the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views.</p>

        <h3>Types of Liberty</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Negative Liberty:</strong> Freedom <em>from</em> interference; the absence of obstacles or constraints on an individual's actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Liberty:</strong> The freedom <em>to</em> act in such a way as to realize one's fundamental purposes or potential; often linked to self-mastery.</li>
            <li><strong>Civil Liberty:</strong> Protections provided by the state to ensure individuals can exercise their basic rights without arbitrary interference.</li>
        </ul>
    </span>

    <span id="spap_equality">
        <h2>Equality</h2>
        <p><strong>Equality</strong> signifies that all individuals are considered equal in status, rights, and opportunities. It is closely linked to justice and liberty.</p>

        <div class="add-horizontal-scroll"><table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type of Equality</th>
                    <th>Core Concept</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Legal Equality</strong></td>
                    <td>Every citizen is subject to the same laws without discrimination.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Social Equality</strong></td>
                    <td>All people in a society have equal social status and opportunities.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Economic Equality</strong></td>
                    <td>A reduction in wealth gaps and provision of equal opportunities for economic advancement.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table></div>
    </span>

    <span id="spap_challenges">
        <h2>Contemporary Challenges: Terrorism and Insurgency</h2>
        <p>Social and political philosophy must address modern threats to the stability and ethical fabric of the state, specifically <strong>Terrorism</strong> and <strong>Insurgency</strong>.</p>

        

        <h3>1. Terrorism</h3>
        <p>Terrorism involves the use of intentional violence, typically against civilians, to create fear for political, religious, or ideological goals. Philosophically, it raises questions about the legitimacy of political violence and the balance between security and civil liberties.</p>

        <h3>2. Insurgency</h3>
        <p>Insurgency is a rebellious act against an established government or authority, often involving armed conflict by a group not recognized as a belligerent. Unlike terrorism, it usually seeks to seize territorial control or political power through a broader social movement.</p>

            <h4>Exam Focus: Unit 5 Enhancements</h4>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the relationship between Liberty and Equality?</strong><br>
            A: They are often seen as complementary but sometimes in tension. Complete liberty for some can lead to inequality, while strict equality enforced by the state can restrict personal liberty.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: How is Insurgency different from a Revolution?</strong><br>
            A: While both involve resistance to authority, a revolution typically aims for a total structural change of the entire system, whereas an insurgency might be more localized or limited in its initial political goals.</p>

            <h3>Exam Tip</h3>
            <p>When discussing <strong>Justice</strong>, referencing its relation to <strong>Ethics</strong> and <strong>Sociology</strong> (as studied in Unit 1) will gain extra marks by showing inter-unit consistency.</p>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <p>Do not treat <strong>Terrorism</strong> and <strong>Insurgency</strong> as the same. Terrorism is primarily a <em>tactic</em> of fear, whereas Insurgency is a <em>political-military strategy</em> used to contest the state's sovereignty over a population.</p>
