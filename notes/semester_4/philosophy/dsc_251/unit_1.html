        <h2>Introduction to Modern Western Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The modern era of Western philosophy is traditionally marked by a shift from the dogmatic authority of the Church and Scholasticism toward <strong>reason</strong> and <strong>scientific inquiry</strong>. Rene Descartes (1596–1650) is widely regarded as the "Father of Modern Philosophy" because he sought to establish a firm, indubitable foundation for all human knowledge.</p>
    </span>

    <span id="spap_descartesMethod">
        <h2>Descartes: Method</h2>
        <h3>Methodological Doubt (Cartesian Doubt)</h3>
        <p>Descartes did not use doubt for the sake of being a skeptic. Instead, he used it as a <strong>tool</strong> to find something that could not possibly be doubted. This is known as <strong>Universal or Radical Doubt</strong>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Doubting the Senses:</strong> Since our senses sometimes deceive us (e.g., optical illusions), they cannot be a foundation for absolute certainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: The Dream Argument:</strong> Descartes argues that we cannot be certain we are not dreaming, as the sensations in dreams are often as vivid as reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: The Evil Demon (Genius) Hypothesis:</strong> He imagines a powerful, deceitful being that tricks his mind even about mathematical truths (like 2+2=4).</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            "Cogito, Ergo Sum" – I think, therefore I am.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Even if a demon is deceiving him, he must <strong>exist</strong> to be deceived. The act of doubting is an act of thinking, and thinking requires a thinker. This is the first indubitable truth of his philosophy.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> In exams, distinguish between "Skeptical Doubt" (doubting to deny knowledge) and "Methodological Doubt" (doubting to discover truth). Descartes is a Rationalist, not a Skeptic.
        </div>
    </span>

    <span id="spap_descartesIdeas">
        <h2>Descartes: Ideas</h2>
        <p>Having established his own existence, Descartes examines the contents of his mind, which he calls <strong>Ideas</strong>. He classifies ideas based on their origin:</p>

        <div class="add-horizontal-scroll"><table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type of Idea</th>
                    <th>Source</th>
                    <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Innate Ideas</strong></td>
                    <td>Born with the mind; placed by God.</td>
                    <td>God, Perfection, Infinity, Identity.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Adventitious Ideas</strong></td>
                    <td>From external sensory experience.</td>
                    <td>Heat of the sun, sound of music.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Factitious Ideas</strong></td>
                    <td>Invented by the imagination.</td>
                    <td>Chimeras, Sirens, Unicorns.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table></div>

        <h3>The Proof of God from Ideas</h3>
        <p>Descartes argues that his idea of a <strong>Perfect Being (God)</strong> could not be factitious (he is imperfect) or adventitious (God isn't sensed). Therefore, it must be <strong>innate</strong>. Since the cause must have at least as much reality as the effect, only a perfect God could have placed the idea of perfection in a human mind.</p>
    </span>

    <span id="spap_descartesSubstance">
        <h2>Descartes: Substance</h2>
        <p>Descartes defines substance as <em>"a thing which exists in such a way as to depend on no other thing for its existence."</em> Strictly speaking, only God fits this definition. However, in a relative sense, he identifies two created substances.</p>

        <h3>Mind-Body Dualism (Cartesian Dualism)</h3>
        <p>Descartes proposes that reality consists of two distinct, independent substances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Res Cogitans (Thinking Substance/Mind):</strong> Its essential attribute is <strong>Thought</strong>. It is non-extended, indivisible, and free.</li>
            <li><strong>Res Extensa (Extended Substance/Body):</strong> Its essential attribute is <strong>Extension</strong> (taking up space). It is unconscious, divisible, and governed by mechanical laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not say Mind and Body are the same in Descartes' view. He is a <strong>Dualist</strong>. The main problem he faced was "Interactionism"—how can a non-physical mind move a physical body? He suggested they interact via the <strong>Pineal Gland</strong>.
        </div>

    <span id="spap_examResources">
        <h2>Exam-Oriented Enhancements</h2>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Why is Descartes called a Rationalist?</strong><br>
            A: Because he believes the foundation of knowledge is reason (the Cogito and Innate Ideas) rather than sensory experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the "Cartesian Circle"?</strong><br>
            A: Critics argue Descartes uses God to prove the reliability of clear/distinct ideas, but uses clear/distinct ideas to prove God exists—this is circular reasoning.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mnemonics for Ideas</h3>
        <p>To remember the three types of ideas, use <strong>"I.A.F."</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I</strong>nnate (Inside us from birth)</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>dventitious (Arrival from outside)</li>
            <li><strong>F</strong>actitious (Fiction of the mind)</li>
        </ul>
