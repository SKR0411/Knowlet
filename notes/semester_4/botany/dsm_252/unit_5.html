    <h2 id="spap_photoperiodism"><span id="spap_photoperiodism">Photoperiodism: SDP, LDP, and DNP</span></h2>
    <p>Photoperiodism is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of night or a dark period. It is most commonly associated with the initiation of flowering in response to the relative lengths of day and night.</p>
    
    <h3>Classification based on Photoperiodic Response</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Short-Day Plants (SDP):</strong> These plants flower when the day length is shorter than a certain critical duration. They actually require a continuous long night period. Examples: Chrysanthemum, Soybean.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Day Plants (LDP):</strong> These plants flower when the day length exceeds a certain critical duration. Examples: Wheat, Radish.</li>
        <li><strong>Day-Neutral Plants (DNP):</strong> These plants flower regardless of the day length. Flowering is often regulated by other factors like age or temperature. Examples: Tomato, Sunflower.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="spap_phytochrome"><span id="spap_phytochrome">Phytochrome: Discovery and Structure</span></h2>
    <p>Phytochrome is a specialized protein pigment that acts as a photoreceptor, absorbing red and far-red light to regulate various developmental processes.</p>
    
    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <p>The existence of phytochrome was first predicted based on the reversible effects of red and far-red light on seed germination and floral induction. It was later isolated as a blue-green pigment.</p>
    
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>Phytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pr Form:</strong> Absorbs red light (approx. 660 nm) and is physiologically inactive.</li>
        <li><strong>Pfr Form:</strong> Absorbs far-red light (approx. 730 nm) and is the physiologically active form that triggers developmental responses.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="spap_photomorphogenesis"><span id="spap_photomorphogenesis">Red and Far-red Light Responses</span></h2>
    <p>Photomorphogenesis is the development of form and structure in plants that is controlled by light. The Pr/Pfr ratio determines the plant's growth pattern.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Red Light Effects:</strong> Promotes seed germination, inhibits stem elongation (leading to sturdier plants), and initiates the development of chloroplasts.</li>
        <li><strong>Far-red Light Effects:</strong> Often reverses the effects of red light. In shade conditions, the higher ratio of far-red light triggers "shade avoidance," causing the plant to elongate its stem rapidly to reach for light.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spap_vernalization"><span id="spap_vernalization">Vernalization</span></h2>
    <blockquote>
        Vernalization is the process by which flowering is promoted by a period of low temperature.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Many plants in temperate regions require a "cold treatment" to ensure they flower during the favorable conditions of spring and summer rather than mid-winter.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Site of Perception:</strong> The cold stimulus is primarily perceived by the shoot apical meristem.</li>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Used in agriculture to shorten the vegetative phase and accelerate flowering in biennial plants like cabbage and carrots.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> The effects of vernalization can sometimes be reversed by high temperatures, a process known as <em>de-vernalization</em>.</li>
    </ul>

        <span class="exam-title">Exam Tips</span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Critical Night Length:</strong> For SDP, the <em>uninterrupted</em> dark period is more critical than the light period. A flash of light during the night can inhibit flowering in SDP.</li>
            <li><strong>Pfr Active Form:</strong> Always remember that **Pfr** is the form that triggers biological responses like flowering and germination.</li>
            <li><strong>SDP vs LDP:</strong> Be ready to identify plants as SDP or LDP based on their flowering season; most spring/summer flowers are LDP, while autumn flowers are often SDP.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="exam-box" style="border-color: #e74c3c;">
        <span class="exam-title" style="color: #c0392b;">Common Mistakes</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinking <strong>Photoperiodism</strong> is just about day length; it is primarily about the duration of the <strong>continuous dark period</strong>.</li>
            <li>Confusing <strong>Vernalization</strong> with <strong>Stratification</strong>; Vernalization is for flowering, while Stratification is the cold treatment of seeds to break dormancy.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="exam-box" style="border-color: #2e86c1;">
        <span class="exam-title" style="color: #21618c;">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</span>
        <p><strong>Q: What happens to phytochrome during the night?</strong><br>
        A: Pfr slowly reverts back to the inactive Pr form in the dark, or it may be degraded by the cell.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can vernalization be replaced by chemicals?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, in some plants, the application of **Gibberellins** can mimic the effects of cold treatment and induce flowering.</p>
