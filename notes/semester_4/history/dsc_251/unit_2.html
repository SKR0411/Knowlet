    <section id="swadeshi">
        <h2>1. The Swadeshi Movement (1905-1908)</h2>
        <p>The Swadeshi Movement was a direct fallout of the British decision to partition Bengal in 1905, led by Lord Curzon. It marked a shift from the "Moderate" politics of petitions to "Extremist" politics of mass action.</p>
        
        <h3>A. Causes: Partition of Bengal</h3>
        <p>The official reason given by the British was <em>administrative convenience</em>. However, the real motive was to weaken Bengal, the nerve center of Indian nationalism, by dividing it on communal lines (East Bengal for Muslims, West Bengal for Hindus).</p>

        <h3>B. Methods of Struggle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boycott:</strong> Refusal to use British-made goods, especially salt and cloth.</li>
            <li><strong>Swadeshi:</strong> Promoting indigenous industries, schools, and courts.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Meetings:</strong> Massive mobilization of students and women for the first time.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Expression:</strong> Songs like 'Amar Sonar Bangla' by Rabindranath Tagore became anthems of unity.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember the <strong>Lal-Bal-Pal</strong> trio (Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Bipin Chandra Pal). They were the primary leaders who pushed for the Swadeshi and Boycott movements beyond Bengal.

    <section id="revolutionary">
        <h2>2. Revolutionary Movements in India and Abroad</h2>
        <p>Disillusioned by the slow pace of the Moderates and the failure of the Swadeshi movement to stop the partition, a section of youth turned toward "Revolutionary Terrorism" (an armed struggle to expel the British).</p>

        <h3>A. Revolutionary Groups in India</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anushilan Samiti:</strong> Formed in Bengal (Promotha Mitter, Jatindranath Banerjee). They advocated physical training and revolutionary thought.</li>
            <li><strong>Jugantar:</strong> An inner circle of Anushilan Samiti that published a weekly paper of the same name.</li>
            <li><strong>Abhinav Bharat:</strong> A secret society started by V.D. Savarkar in Maharashtra (1904).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Revolutionary Activities Abroad</h3>
        <p>Indian revolutionaries operated from foreign soil to smuggle arms and literature into India.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>India House (London):</strong> Established by Shyamji Krishna Varma.</li>
            <li><strong>Madam Bhikaji Cama:</strong> Known as the "Mother of Indian Revolution," she unfurled the first Indian National Flag at Stuttgart, Germany, in 1907.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ghadar">
        <h2>3. The Ghadar Party</h2>
        <p>The Ghadar Party was an international political movement founded by expatriate Indians to overthrow British rule in India.</p>

        <h3>A. Key Facts</h3>
        <div class="add-horizontal-scroll"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Founded</th>
                <td>1913</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Headquarters</th>
                <td>Yugantar Ashram, San Francisco, USA</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Main Leaders</th>
                <td>Lala Hardayal, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Kartar Singh Sarabha</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Journal</th>
                <td>'The Ghadar' (Weekly)</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>

        <h3>B. Objectives and Outcome</h3>
        <p>The Ghadarites aimed to incite a rebellion within the Indian Army. However, their plans for a 1915 uprising were leaked, leading to massive arrests and the execution of many leaders. Despite its failure, it inspired future revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh.</p>

    <section id="home-rule">
        <h2>4. The Home Rule Movement</h2>
        <p>Launched during World War I (1916), this movement demanded "Home Rule" or self-government for India within the British Empire, similar to the status enjoyed by Australia or Canada.</p>

        <h3>A. The Two Leagues</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Tilak's League:</strong> Established in April 1916. Operated in Maharashtra (excluding Bombay), Karnataka, and Central Provinces.</li>
            <li><strong>Annie Besant's League:</strong> Established in September 1916. Operated in the rest of India.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>B. Significance</h3>
        <p>The movement shifted the focus back to political agitation after a period of lull. It led to the <strong>Lucknow Pact (1916)</strong>, where the Congress and the Muslim League joined hands, and the Moderates and Extremists reunited.</p>

        <h2>5. Exam Prep</h2>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse the 1905 Swadeshi Movement with Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement. Swadeshi was primarily led by the Extremists (Lal-Bal-Pal) before Gandhi's rise to prominence in India.
        </div>

        <h3>FAQs</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: What was the 'Annulment of Partition'?</strong><br>
        A: Due to the intense Swadeshi protest, the British finally reunited Bengal in 1911, though they moved the capital from Calcutta to Delhi at the same time.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What was the slogan given by Tilak during the Home Rule Movement?</strong><br>
        A: "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it!"</p>

        <h3>Summary Mnemonic</h3>
        <p><strong>"S-R-G-H"</strong>: <strong>S</strong>wadeshi (1905), <strong>R</strong>evolutionaries (1907+), <strong>G</strong>hadar (1913), <strong>H</strong>ome Rule (1916).</p>
