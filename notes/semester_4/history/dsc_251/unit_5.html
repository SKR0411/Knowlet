    <h1>Unit 5: The Final Phase and Partition</h1>
    
    <p>This unit examines the decisive events between 1942 and 1947 that led to the end of British colonial rule and the creation of the independent dominions of India and Pakistan.</p>

    <h2>1. The Quit India Movement (1942)</h2>
    <p>Launched in August 1942, this was the most massive and violent struggle of the Indian freedom movement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Failure of the Cripps Mission and rising wartime inflation/shortages.</li>
        <li><strong>Slogan:</strong> Mahatma Gandhi gave the call <span class="important">"Do or Die"</span> (Karo ya Maro).</li>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> It was a "leaderless movement" as all major leaders were arrested immediately. It saw widespread sabotage of communication lines and the establishment of parallel governments in places like Satara and Ballia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. INA and Subhas Chandra Bose</h2>
    <p>While the civil movement was happening within India, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose organized resistance from the outside.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj):</strong> Originally formed by Mohan Singh, Netaji took command in 1943.</li>
        <li><strong>Significance:</strong> The INA's march toward India and the subsequent <span class="important">Red Fort Trials</span> (1945) created an unprecedented wave of nationalism within the British Indian Army itself.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>3. The RIN Revolt (1946)</h2>
    <p>In February 1946, ratings of the <strong>Royal Indian Navy (RIN)</strong> in Bombay went on strike.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> It signaled to the British that they could no longer rely on the Indian armed forces to sustain their rule.</li>
        <li>This event, combined with post-war economic strain, accelerated the British decision to leave India.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Partition and Independence (1947)</h2>
    <p>The final constitutional steps toward freedom were marked by communal tension and political deadlock.</p>
    <div class="summary-box">
        <h3>Key Steps to Freedom:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cabinet Mission Plan (1946):</strong> Aimed to keep India united with a loose federal structure but was ultimately rejected due to disagreements over provincial grouping.</li>
            <li><strong>Mountbatten Plan (June 3, 1947):</strong> Accepted the principle of partition and set the date for the transfer of power.</li>
            <li><strong>Indian Independence Act (1947):</strong> Formally created two independent dominions on August 15, 1947.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <h2>5. Expected Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>By the end of this unit, students should understand the revolutionary shifts in the 1940s, the role of military resistance, and the complex factors that led to the partition of the subcontinent.</p>
