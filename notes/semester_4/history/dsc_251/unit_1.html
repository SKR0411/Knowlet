        <h2>1. Factors Responsible for the Growth of Indian Nationalism</h2>
        <p>The rise of nationalistic feelings in India was not a sudden event but a result of several complex factors that converged in the late 19th century.</p>
        
        <h3>A. Impact of British Rule</h3>
        <p>The political and administrative unification of India under the British provided a common framework. The introduction of modern means of transport like <strong>Railways</strong> and communication like the <strong>Telegraph</strong> physically linked different parts of the country, facilitating the exchange of ideas among leaders from different regions.</p>
        
        <h3>B. Western Education and Ideas</h3>
        <p>The spread of English education exposed Indians to Western liberal thoughts, including concepts of <strong>democracy, liberty, and equality</strong>. Thinkers like Mill, Rousseau, and Spencer influenced the emerging Indian middle-class intelligentsia.</p>
        
        <h3>C. Economic Exploitation</h3>
        <p>The "Drain of Wealth" theory, popularized by Dadabhai Naoroji, highlighted how British policies were impoverishing India. The ruin of traditional handicrafts and the high land revenue demands created widespread resentment among peasants and artisans.</p>
        
        <h3>D. Socio-Religious Reform Movements</h3>
        <p>Movements led by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Dayananda Saraswati, and others sought to reform Indian society and instill a sense of pride in Indian culture and heritage, which counteracted the feeling of racial inferiority imposed by colonial rule.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> In questions about the rise of nationalism, always mention the role of the <strong>Vernacular Press Act (1878)</strong> and the <strong>Ilbert Bill Controversy (1883)</strong> as immediate catalysts that unified Indian opinion against racial discrimination.

        <h2>2. Growth of Political Associations before 1885</h2>
        <p>Before the birth of the Indian National Congress, several regional associations paved the way for a national-level organization.</p>

        <h2>3. Circumstances Leading to the Foundation of the Indian National Congress</h2>
        <p>The need for an all-India political platform reached a peak by the early 1880s.</p>
        
        <h3>A. The Role of A.O. Hume</h3>
        <p>Allan Octavian Hume, a retired British civil servant, played a pivotal role. He organized the first session to provide a "safety valve" for the release of Indian grievances, preventing another 1857-style violent uprising.</p>

        <h3>B. The First Session (1885)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "The first meeting of the Indian National Congress took place at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay in December 1885. It was presided over by Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee."
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>C. Initial Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To promote friendly relations between political workers from different parts of the country.</li>
            <li>To develop and consolidate feelings of national unity irrespective of caste, religion, or province.</li>
            <li>To formulate popular demands and present them before the government.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="activities-inc">
        <h2>4. Activities of the Indian National Congress (1885-1905)</h2>
        <p>This period is known as the <strong>Moderate Phase</strong>. The leaders of this era, such as Pherozeshah Mehta, Dadabhai Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, believed in constitutional methods.</p>

        <h3>A. Methodology: The 3 P's</h3>
        <p>The Moderates followed a policy of <strong>Prayer, Petition, and Protest</strong>. They believed that the British were essentially just and would grant reforms if the Indian case was presented logically.</p>

        <h3>B. Major Demands</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Constitutional:</strong> Expansion of Legislative Councils and increasing Indian representation.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Reduction of land revenue, abolition of salt tax, and decrease in military expenditure.</li>
            <li><strong>Administrative:</strong> Holding Civil Service examinations simultaneously in India and England, and separation of the judiciary from the executive.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>C. Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a wide national awakening among the urban educated class.</li>
            <li>Critiqued colonial economics through the "Drain Theory."</li>
            <li>The <strong>Indian Councils Act of 1892</strong> was largely a result of their efforts, even though it did not fully satisfy their demands.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not assume the Moderates were "weak." While their methods were non-confrontational, they provided the intellectual foundation for the later, more aggressive phases of the freedom struggle.

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: What was the 'Safety Valve' theory?</strong><br>
        A: It is the theory that the British allowed the creation of the INC to provide a peaceful outlet for Indian political discontent, thereby avoiding a violent revolution.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Name the prominent 'Moderate' leaders.</strong><br>
        A: Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, D.E. Wacha, W.C. Bonnerjee, and S.N. Banerjea.</p>

        <h3>Mnemonics for Pre-INC Associations</h3>
        <p>Use <strong>"B-B-E-P-I-M"</strong> to remember the order: <strong>B</strong>angabhasha (1836), <strong>B</strong>ritish India (1851), <strong>E</strong>ast India (1866), <strong>P</strong>oona Sarvajanik (1870), <strong>I</strong>ndian Association (1876), <strong>M</strong>adras Mahajan (1884).</p>
