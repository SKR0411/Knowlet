    [cite_start]<p>This unit examines the radical shift in Indian history with the arrival of the Mughals, the brief interlude of Afghan revival under Sher Shah, and the stabilization of the empire under Akbar [cite: 1735-1740].</p>

    <h2 id="babur">1. Foundation of the Mughal Empire by Babur</h2>
    <p>Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur founded the Mughal dynasty in 1526, ending the era of the Delhi Sultanate.</p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>First Battle of Panipat (1526):</strong> Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi using superior military tactics like the <em>Tulghuma</em> (flanking) system and gunpowder/artillery for the first time in North India[cite: 1736].</li>
        <li><strong>Battle of Khanwa (1527):</strong> He defeated the Rajput confederacy led by Rana Sanga, securing his position in Northern India.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle of Ghaghra (1529):</strong> He defeated the Afghan chiefs of Bihar and Bengal, solidifying Mughal control over the Indo-Gangetic plains.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sher-shah">2. Administration of Sher Shah Suri</h2>
    <p>Sher Shah Suri (1540-1545) established the Second Afghan Empire. [cite_start]Though his reign was short, his administrative reforms became a blueprint for later Mughal rulers[cite: 1737].</p>

    <h3>Administrative Reforms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Land Revenue:</strong> Introduced the <em>Rai</em> (schedule of crop rates) and measured land for taxation. [cite_start]He established the <em>Zabit</em> system, where the state's share was fixed at 1/3rd of the produce[cite: 1737].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Currency:</strong> He introduced the silver <strong>Rupia</strong> and copper <strong>Dam</strong>, which served as the basis for the modern Indian Rupee[cite: 1737].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Built the <strong>Grand Trunk Road</strong> connecting Sonargaon (Bengal) to Peshawar (now in Pakistan) and established <em>Sarais</em> (inns) for travelers[cite: 1737].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Local Responsibility:</strong> Implemented the principle of local responsibility for local crimes; village headmen were held accountable for robberies in their area[cite: 1737].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="akbar">3. Akbar: Religious Policy & Din-i-Ilahi</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Akbar (1556-1605) realized that an empire in India could not survive without the support of the majority Hindu population[cite: 1738].</p>

    <h3>Phases of Religious Development</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Ibadat Khana (1575):</strong> He built the "House of Worship" at Fatehpur Sikri, initially for Islamic scholars and later opened to all religions (Hindus, Jains, Christians, Parsis) to discuss theological truths[cite: 1738].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Sulh-i-Kul:</strong> He promoted the policy of "Universal Peace," emphasizing tolerance and the harmony of all religions[cite: 1738].</li>
        <li><strong>Din-i-Ilahi (1582):</strong> He introduced a moral code known as <em>Din-i-Ilahi</em> (Divine Monotheism), which synthesized the best elements of different faiths. [cite_start]It was not a proselytizing religion but a group of loyalists emphasizing ethical conduct[cite: 1738].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mughal-admin">4. Mughal Administrative System</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Akbar formalized the administrative structure that governed India for centuries[cite: 1739].</p>

    <h3>Central and Local Administration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mansabdari System:</strong> A unique system of ranking officers based on <em>Zat</em> (personal rank) and <em>Sawar</em> (number of cavalrymen maintained). [cite_start]It integrated the military and civil bureaucracy[cite: 1739].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Dahshala System:</strong> A land revenue system introduced by Raja Todar Mal, where revenue was based on the average produce and prices of the last ten years[cite: 1739].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Divisions:</strong> The empire was divided into <em>Subas</em> (Provinces), <em>Sarkars</em> (Districts), and <em>Parganas</em> (Groups of Villages)[cite: 1739].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="exam-prep">5. Exam Focus: Tips and Common Pitfalls</h2>

    <div class="exam-tip-box">
        <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Sher Shah Suri is often called the "Forerunner of Akbar." In your answers, link his land revenue and administrative policies to how Akbar later refined them.
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Don't describe <em>Din-i-Ilahi</em> as a full-fledged religion that thousands followed. [cite_start]It was a courtly order with a very small number of members (like Birbal)[cite: 1738].
