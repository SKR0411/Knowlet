    [cite_start]<p>This final unit explores the transformation of the Mughal Empire under its last great emperor, Aurangzeb, the formidable challenge posed by the Marathas, and the structural causes that led to the disintegration of one of the world's most powerful empires [cite: 1741-1746].</p>

    <h2 id="aurangzeb-religion">1. Aurangzeb: His Religious Policy</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Aurangzeb (1658–1707) reversed many of the liberal policies of his predecessors, particularly Akbar[cite: 1742]. His religious policy was characterized by a strict adherence to Islamic orthodoxy.</p>

    <h3>Key Actions and Impacts</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Reintroduction of Jizya (1679):</strong> He brought back the poll tax on non-Muslim subjects, which alienated the Rajputs, Marathas, and Hindus[cite: 1742].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Temple Destructions:</strong> He ordered the destruction of several prominent temples (e.g., Vishwanath temple in Kashi) during times of political rebellion, though he also issued land grants to others[cite: 1742].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Strict Moral Codes:</strong> He appointed <em>Muhtasibs</em> to enforce Sharia law and regulate public moral conduct[cite: 1742].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Impact:</strong> These policies created widespread resentment and contributed to the rise of regional resistances among the Sikhs, Jats, and Satnamis[cite: 1748].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="maratha-rise">2. Rise of Maratha Power under Shivaji</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj emerged as a symbol of regional pride and resistance against Mughal dominance in the Deccan[cite: 1743].</p>

    <h3>Factors Behind the Rise</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Geographical Advantage:</strong> The rugged terrain of the Western Ghats was perfect for Shivaji’s <em>Ganimi Kava</em> (Guerrilla Warfare)[cite: 1743].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Military Innovation:</strong> Shivaji focused on building a strong infantry and a naval fleet, earning him the title "Father of the Indian Navy"[cite: 1743].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Spirit of Swarajya:</strong> He successfully mobilized the Maratha peasantry and warrior clans under the ideal of <em>Hindavi Swarajya</em> (Self-rule)[cite: 1743].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="shivaji-admin">3. Shivaji's Administration</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Shivaji’s administration was highly systematic and aimed at public welfare rather than just military conquest[cite: 1744].</p>

    <h3>The Ashta Pradhan Council</h3>
    [cite_start]<p>He was assisted by a council of eight ministers known as the <strong>Ashta Pradhan</strong>[cite: 1744].</p>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Senapati</strong></td>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Revenue System</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Chauth:</strong> A tax amounting to 1/4th of the land revenue, collected from neighboring territories in exchange for protection from Maratha raids[cite: 1744].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Sardeshmukhi:</strong> An additional 10% tax claimed as the hereditary head (Deshmukh) of the Maratha nation[cite: 1744].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mughal-downfall">4. Downfall of the Mughal Empire</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>The death of Aurangzeb in 1707 signaled the beginning of the rapid decline of the Mughal Empire[cite: 1745].</p>

    <div class="diagram-box">
        
    </div>

    <h3>Primary Causes of Decline</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Religious and Rajput Policies:</strong> Alienation of loyal Rajput allies and other groups weakened the state's foundation[cite: 1742, 1748].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>The Deccan Ulcer:</strong> Aurangzeb’s 25-year-long war in the Deccan depleted the imperial treasury and exhausted the military[cite: 1745].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Weak Successors:</strong> Later Mughals were incompetent and became puppets in the hands of powerful nobles (the "Sayyid Brothers")[cite: 1745].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Economic Crisis:</strong> Failure of the <em>Jagirdari</em> system and excessive taxation led to peasant distress[cite: 1745].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Foreign Invasions:</strong> The raids by Nadir Shah (1739) and Ahmad Shah Abdali shattered the central authority and prestige of Delhi[cite: 1745].</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="exam-note">
        <strong>Exam Corner: Tips & Tricks</strong>
        [cite_start]<p><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Always contrast Aurangzeb’s Deccan policy with Akbar's Rajput policy to show the shift in the empire’s stability[cite: 1748].</p>
        
        [cite_start]<p><strong>Mnemonic for Ashta Pradhan:</strong> Remember <strong>P.A.S.S.</strong> (Peshwa, Amatya, Senapati, Sumant) to cover the top four ministers in Shivaji's council[cite: 1744].</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: What was the significance of the Treaty of Purandar?</strong><br>
        [cite_start]A: It forced Shivaji to cede 23 forts to the Mughals and enter into a temporary alliance, though he later escaped and rebuilt his power[cite: 1743].</p>
