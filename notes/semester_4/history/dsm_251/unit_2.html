    <p>This unit focuses on the transition of the Sultanate into a highly centralized and innovative state [cite: 1723-1727]. We analyze the radical market reforms of the Khaljis, the controversial experimental projects of the Tughluqs, and the systemic factors that led to the eventual collapse of the Delhi Sultanate.</p>

    <h2 id="market-control">1. Alauddin Khalji's Economic and Market Policies</h2>
    <p>Alauddin Khalji was the first Sultan to significantly intervene in the economy to maintain a large standing army.</p>

    <h3>Market Control Regulations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price Fixation:</strong> He strictly fixed the prices of all essential commodities, from food grains to cloth and even slaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Separate Markets:</strong> Three distinct markets were established in Delhi: one for grains, one for costly cloth/sugar/oil, and one for horses/cattle/slaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative Officers:</strong> Each market was under a high officer called the <em>Shahna-i-Mandi</em>, who ensured no cheating occurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence System:</strong> Spies known as <em>Munhiyans</em> reported daily price fluctuations directly to the Sultan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Land Revenue Reforms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Collection:</strong> He abolished intermediary local chiefs (Khuts and Muqaddams) to collect revenue directly from peasants.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement System:</strong> Revenue was based on the measurement of land (<em>Biswa</em>), ensuring a more scientific tax base.</li>
        <li><strong>State Share:</strong> The state demand was raised to 50% of the produce to fund his military expansion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tughluq-schemes">2. Muhammad-bin-Tughluq's Administrative Schemes</h2>
    <p>Known for his intellectual brilliance but practical failures, Muhammad-bin-Tughluq launched several ambitious projects.</p>

    <h3>Major Experimental Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transfer of Capital (1327):</strong> He moved the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Devagiri) to better control South India. The forced migration of the entire population led to immense suffering and the project was eventually abandoned.</li>
        <li><strong>Token Currency:</strong> He introduced bronze/copper coins to be treated at par with silver coins. Due to widespread counterfeiting and lack of state control over minting, the economy was severely disrupted.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxation in the Doab:</strong> Increased taxes in the fertile Doab region coincided with a severe famine, leading to peasant revolts.</li>
        <li><strong>Khurasan and Qarachil Expeditions:</strong> These massive military mobilizations ended in failure and depleted the state treasury.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sultanate-admin">3. Administrative Structure of the Delhi Sultanate</h2>
    <p>The Sultanate administration was a blend of Perso-Arabic traditions and Indian realities.</p>

    <h3>Central Administration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Sultan:</strong> He was the head of the state, the commander-in-chief, and the chief justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Wazir (Diwan-i-Wizarat):</strong> The Prime Minister in charge of revenue and finance.</li>
        <li><strong>Ariz-i-Mamalik (Diwan-i-Arz):</strong> The minister responsible for the military department, including recruitment and inspection.</li>
        <li><strong>Diwan-i-Insha:</strong> Handled state correspondence and royal decrees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Provincial and Local Setup</h3>
    <p>The empire was divided into <em>Shis</em> (provinces) governed by <em>Muqtis</em> or <em>Walis</em>, who were responsible for law, order, and revenue collection. These were further subdivided into <em>Parganas</em> (groups of villages).</p>

    <h2 id="downfall-causes">4. Causes of the Downfall of the Delhi Sultanate</h2>
    <p>The decline of the Sultanate was a gradual process caused by several internal and external factors.</p>

        <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
        <p>Focus on the "Why" and "How" of Muhammad-bin-Tughluq's failures—examiners look for the logic behind his schemes rather than just a list of events. For Alauddin Khalji, memorize the names of market officials like <strong>Shahna-i-Mandi</strong> and <strong>Barid</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mislabeling Coins:</strong> Don't say Muhammad-bin-Tughluq "invented" coins; emphasize he introduced <strong>Token Currency</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Chronology:</strong> Ensure you place the downfall factors in the correct era; the decline started after the Tughluqs and peaked during the Lodi era.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Why did the market reforms of Alauddin Khalji die with him?</strong><br>
        A: They were based on force and terror rather than sound economic principles, making them unsustainable without his personal supervision.</p>
