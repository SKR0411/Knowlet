    <p>This unit explores the critical period of Indian history marked by the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. It covers the transition from regional kingdoms to a centralized Islamic empire, focusing on the roles of the initial three most influential rulers of the Slave (Mamluk) Dynasty.</p>

    <h2 id="sources">1. Sources of Medieval Indian History</h2>
    <p>The reconstruction of medieval Indian history relies on two primary categories of evidence: <strong>Literary</strong> and <strong>Archaeological</strong>.</p>

    <h3>A. Literary Sources</h3>
    <p>Literary sources provide detailed narratives, though they often reflect the perspectives of court historians.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi:</strong> Written by Ziauddin Barani, it provides insights into the administration and economic policies of the Tughluq period.</li>
        <li><strong>Tabaqat-i-Nasiri:</strong> Minhaj-us-Siraj's work is a vital contemporary account of the early Mamluk rulers like Iltutmish.</li>
        <li><strong>Travelogues:</strong> Works by foreign visitors like Ibn Battuta (Rihla) offer a non-courtly perspective on social and economic life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Archaeological Sources</h3>
    <p>Physical remains offer tangible evidence that complements or verifies literary records.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inscriptions (Epigraphy):</strong> Found on mosque walls and monuments, these provide dates, names of rulers, and details of victories.</li>
        <li><strong>Numismatics (Coins):</strong> The study of coins helps determine the economic health of the Sultanate and the extent of a Sultan's territory. For example, Iltutmish's silver Tanka and copper Jital.</li>
        <li><strong>Monuments:</strong> Architecture like the Qutub Minar and Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque showcases the fusion of Indo-Islamic styles and the religious/political aspirations of the rulers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="aibak">2. Qutubuddin Aibak: Conquests & Achievements</h2>
    <p>Qutubuddin Aibak (1206-1210 CE) was the founder of the Slave Dynasty and the first Sultan of Delhi.</p>

    <h3>Conquests</h3>
    <p>Aibak was a trusted general of Muhammad Ghori. His primary task was to secure the Ghorid conquests in Northern India.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>North Indian Campaigns:</strong> He solidified control over areas like Delhi, Meerut, and Ajmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Independence from Ghazni:</strong> After Ghori's death, Aibak broke ties with Ghazni and established Delhi as an independent political center.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lakh-Baksh:</strong> Known for his generosity, he was titled "Lakh-Baksh" (Giver of Lakhs).</li>
        <li><strong>Architectural Foundation:</strong> He started the construction of the Qutub Minar and built the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque in Delhi and Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra in Ajmer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="iltutmish">3. Iltutmish: Consolidation of the Sultanate</h2>
    <p>Shamsuddin Iltutmish (1211-1236 CE) is considered the <strong>real consolidator</strong> of the Delhi Sultanate. He inherited a fragile kingdom and transformed it into a stable empire.</p>

    <h3>Key Consolidation Measures</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Suppression of Rivals:</strong> He defeated rivals like Yalduz and Qubacha to secure his position.</li>
        <li><strong>The Mongol Threat:</strong> He diplomatically averted a Mongol invasion by refusing shelter to Jalaluddin Mangabarni, thus saving the infant Sultanate from Genghis Khan.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative Reforms:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Iqtadari System:</strong> He organized the empire into 'Iqtas' (land grants) given to officers in lieu of salary, ensuring military and revenue stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Turkan-i-Chahalgani (The Forty):</strong> He created a loyal corps of 40 elite Turkish slaves to assist in administration.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> He introduced the standard silver Tanka and copper Jital.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        Formula for Sultanate Stability = Strong Central Military + Systematic Revenue (Iqta) + Standardized Currency.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="balban">4. Ghiasuddin Balban: Theory of Kingship</h2>
    <p>Ghiasuddin Balban (1266-1287 CE) took power during a time of chaos and used a harsh but effective philosophy to restore order.</p>

    <h3>The Theory of Kingship</h3>
    <p>Balban believed that the King must be a figure of absolute awe and power to ensure obedience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Zil-i-Ilahi:</strong> He claimed to be the "Shadow of God" on Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Niyabat-i- خدای (Niyabat-i-Khudai):</strong> He asserted that the kingship is a divine gift.</li>
        <li><strong>Blood and Iron Policy:</strong> He used ruthless force to suppress internal rebellions (like the Mewatis) and defend against Mongol raids.</li>
        <li><strong>Court Decorum:</strong> He introduced <strong>Sijda</strong> (prostration) and <strong>Paibos</strong> (kissing the Sultan's feet) to emphasize the Sultan's superiority over the nobility.</li>
        <li><strong>Destruction of 'The Forty':</strong> Recognizing the power of the elite corps he once belonged to, he systematically weakened the Turkan-i-Chahalgani to remove any challenge to his authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="exam-prep">5. Exam-Focused Enhancements</h2>

    <div class="exam-tip">
        <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When writing about Iltutmish, always emphasize why he is called the "Real Founder" compared to Aibak. Mention the Iqtadari system and the Mongol policy as these are high-scoring points.
    </div>

    <div class="common-mistake">
        <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse the "Iqta" system with the later Mughal "Mansab" system. While both involve land and military service, the administrative structures and contexts were different.
    </div>
