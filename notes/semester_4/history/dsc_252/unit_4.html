        <h2>1. Battle of Saraighat and Lachit Barphukan</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Battle of Saraighat (1671)</strong> was the most significant naval battle fought between the Ahoms and the Mughals on the Brahmaputra river at Saraighat.</p>
        
        <h3>Lachit Barphukan's Leadership</h3>
        <p>Lachit Barphukan was appointed as the commander of the Ahom forces by King <strong>Chakradhwaj Singha</strong>. He is celebrated for his patriotism and military genius.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Knowing the Mughals were superior on land, Lachit forced them into a naval battle in the narrowest part of the Brahmaputra (Saraighat).</li>
            <li><strong>The Incident of the Momai:</strong> Legend says he beheaded his own maternal uncle for negligence in building a defensive wall, stating, <em>"Deshot koi Momai dangor nohoy"</em> (My uncle is not greater than my country).</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The Mughal forces under Ram Singh were decisively defeated, and Guwahati was recovered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Reign of Gadadhar Singha: Restoration of Order</h2>
        <p>Gadadhar Singha (reign: 1681–1696 CE), previously known as <strong>Gadapani</strong>, ended the period of "Ministerial Rule" and political instability.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Battle of Itakhuli (1682):</strong> He finally expelled the Mughals from Assam, pushing them back to the Manas river. This remained the boundary until 1826.</li>
            <li><strong>Suppression of Internal Conflicts:</strong> He crushed the over-powerful nobles and restored the absolute authority of the King.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurement of Land:</strong> He initiated a detailed survey and measurement of land to fix the revenue system.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Mention the role of his wife, <strong>Joymoti</strong>, who sacrificed her life to protect him while he was a fugitive. This is a crucial cultural-historical point.

        <h2>3. Rudra Singha: The Peak of Ahom Glory</h2>
        <p>Rudra Singha (reign: 1696–1714 CE) is considered the most illustrious Ahom king. Under him, the kingdom reached its cultural and political zenith.</p>

        <h3>Political and Cultural Zenith:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>City Building:</strong> He established the new capital at <strong>Rangpur</strong> and built the Talatal Ghar and the Rang Ghar (initial structure).</li>
            <li><strong>Confederacy Plans:</strong> He planned a grand confederacy of Hindu kings to invade Bengal and drive out the Mughals, though his death prevented its execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Satriya Culture:</strong> He patronized the Neo-Vaishnavite Sattras and encouraged literature and arts.</li>

        <h2>4. The Moamaria Rebellion: Causes and Consequences</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Moamaria Rebellion (1769–1806)</strong> was a prolonged civil war that broke the backbone of the Ahom state.</p>

        <h3>Causes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Religious Friction:</strong> Conflict between the Ahom kings (who leaned towards Shaktism) and the Moamaria Mahantas (followers of the Mayamara Sattra).</li>
            <li><strong>Social Inequality:</strong> The rigid Paik system was becoming oppressive, and the Moamaria disciples (mostly lower castes and tribes) sought social equality.</li>
            <li><strong>Insult to Mahanta:</strong> The public humiliation of the Moamaria Mahanta by Ahom officials acted as the immediate spark.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consequences:</h3>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Political</strong></td>

            <strong>Q: What was the significance of the Battle of Itakhuli?</strong><br>

        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <strong>Q: Why did the Paik system fail during the Moamaria rebellion?</strong><br>
            A: The rebellion was a mass uprising of the Paiks themselves. When the workforce turned into rebels, the state lost both its army and its revenue base.
