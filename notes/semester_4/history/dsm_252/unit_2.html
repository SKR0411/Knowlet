    [cite_start]<p>This unit examines the struggle between the conservative forces that sought to restore the old order in Europe after Napoleon's defeat and the rising tide of liberalism and nationalism [cite: 1768-1772].</p>

    <h2 id="vienna">1. Main Provisions of the Vienna Congress</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>The Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) was a meeting of ambassadors from European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich[cite: 1780]. [cite_start]Its primary goal was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars[cite: 1780].</p>

    <h3>Key Principles and Provisions:</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> Restoring the "legitimate" monarchs who had been deposed by Napoleon to their thrones, such as the Bourbons in France, Spain, and Naples[cite: 1780].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Balance of Power:</strong> Ensuring that no single power could ever dominate Europe again by redistributing territories among the major powers[cite: 1780].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Containment of France:</strong> Establishing strong "buffer states" around France to prevent future French aggression[cite: 1780].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Rewarding countries that had contributed most to Napoleon's defeat with new territories[cite: 1780].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="concert">2. The Concert of Europe</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>The Concert of Europe was a system of dispute resolution adopted by the major conservative powers of Europe (Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain) to maintain the status quo and suppress revolutionary movements[cite: 1781].</p>

    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Collective Security:</strong> The powers agreed to meet in periodically scheduled congresses to discuss and resolve European problems collectively[cite: 1781].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Interventionism:</strong> Under the "Metternich System," the major powers claimed the right to intervene in other states to crush liberal or nationalistic revolts[cite: 1781].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Decline:</strong> The system eventually weakened due to conflicting interests among the powers, particularly Britain’s move toward a policy of non-intervention[cite: 1781].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="july">3. July Revolution (1830): Causes & Effects</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>The July Revolution in France, also known as the "Three Glorious Days," saw the overthrow of the Bourbon King Charles X and the ascent of his cousin Louis-Philippe[cite: 1782].</p>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>The July Ordinances:</strong> Charles X issued strict decrees that suspended the liberty of the press, dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, and reduced the number of voters[cite: 1782].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Reactionary Policies:</strong> Attempting to restore the absolute power and privileges of the nobility and clergy[cite: 1782].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Effects:</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Establishment of Constitutional Monarchy:</strong> Louis-Philippe became the "Citizen King" under a revised constitution[cite: 1782].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Spread of Revolution:</strong> Sparked similar revolts across Europe, most notably leading to the independence of Belgium from the Netherlands[cite: 1782].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="february">4. February Revolution (1848): Causes & Effects</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>The February Revolution ended the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe and led to the creation of the French Second Republic[cite: 1783].</p>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Economic Distress:</strong> A severe industrial crisis and crop failures led to unemployment and hunger among the working class[cite: 1783].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Political Corruption:</strong> The government's refusal to extend voting rights to the middle and working classes[cite: 1783].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>The Reform Banquets:</strong> When the government banned a large political gathering (banquet), riots broke out in Paris[cite: 1783].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Effects:</h3>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>The "Springtime of Peoples":</strong> Sparked a wave of revolutions across Europe, including in Germany, Italy, and the Austrian Empire[cite: 1783].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Rise of Louis-Napoleon:</strong> Eventually led to the election of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (later Napoleon III) as President[cite: 1783].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <div class="exam-tip">
        <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember that the Revolution of 1830 was primarily a middle-class victory for constitutional monarchy, whereas the 1848 Revolution saw a greater involvement of the working class and demanded republicanism and socialism.
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not confuse the July Revolution (1830) with the February Revolution (1848). One changed the king; the other abolished the monarchy entirely.
