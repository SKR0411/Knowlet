    <p>This unit provides an understanding of the transition from a Euro-centric history to a global perspective following World War I. It focuses on the peace settlements that attempted to redefine the world order and the turbulent political climate that followed.</p>

    <h2 id="wilson-points">1. Wilson's Fourteen Points</h2>
    <p>In January 1918, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson presented a blueprint for world peace known as the "Fourteen Points". These points aimed to address the causes of the war and prevent future conflicts.</p>

    <h3>Key Principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Diplomacy:</strong> An end to secret treaties and alliances.</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom of the Seas:</strong> Ensuring navigation rights during peace and war.</li>
        <li><strong>Removal of Economic Barriers:</strong> Encouraging free trade between nations.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduction of Armaments:</strong> Lowering military stockpiles to the minimum level consistent with domestic safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Determination:</strong> The right of ethnic groups to determine their own political future and borders.</li>
        <li><strong>League of Nations:</strong> The creation of a general association of nations to guarantee political independence and territorial integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="paris-conference">2. Paris Peace Conference</h2>
    <p>The Paris Peace Conference began in January 1919 to determine the terms of peace following the armistice. It was dominated by the "Big Three": Woodrow Wilson (USA), David Lloyd George (Great Britain), and Georges Clemenceau (France).</p>

    <h3>Objectives of the Powers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>France:</strong> Desired national security and heavy reparations to weaken Germany permanently.</li>
        <li><strong>Great Britain:</strong> Sought to punish Germany but wanted her to remain a viable trading partner.</li>
        <li><strong>USA:</strong> Focused on establishing a new world order based on the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="treaty-versailles">3. Treaty of Versailles: Provisions and Appraisal</h2>
    <p>The Treaty of Versailles was the most significant document emerging from the conference, signed on June 28, 1919.</p>

    <h3>Main Provisions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Territorial Changes:</strong> Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine to France, Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium, and the "Polish Corridor" to Poland.</li>
        <li><strong>Disarmament:</strong> The German army was limited to 100,000 men, the navy was restricted, and air forces were banned.</li>
        <li><strong>War Guilt Clause (Article 231):</strong> Germany was forced to accept full responsibility for causing the war.</li>
        <li><strong>Reparations:</strong> Germany was required to pay massive financial compensation, later fixed at 6.6 billion pounds.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h3>Critical Appraisal</h3>
    <p>The treaty is often viewed as a "Dictated Peace" (Diktat). While it aimed to ensure peace, its harshness and perceived injustices became a source of German resentment that later fueled the rise of Nazism.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "The Treaty of Versailles was a peace of vengeance that contained the seeds of another war."
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="other-treaties">4. Other Peace Treaties</h2>
    <p>Besides Germany, separate treaties were signed with the other Central Powers:</p>

            <td><strong>Treaty of Sevres</strong></td>
            <td>Turkey</td>

        <h2>5. Exam Corner</h2>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> In questions about the Treaty of Versailles, always mention <strong>Article 231</strong> (The War Guilt Clause). It was the most psychologically damaging part for the German people.
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not assume the USA joined the League of Nations. Despite Wilson's advocacy, the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the treaty, which significantly weakened the League.

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why was the Treaty of Versailles called a 'Diktat'?</strong><br>
            Germany was not allowed to participate in the negotiations; they were simply presented with the document and told to sign it or face invasion.</li>
            <li><strong>What was the purpose of the 'Polish Corridor'?</strong><br>
            To provide the newly independent nation of Poland with access to the Baltic Sea, though it physically separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany.</li>
