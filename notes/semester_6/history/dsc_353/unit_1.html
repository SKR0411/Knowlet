    <p>This unit explores the critical period of British history where the struggle between the Monarchy and Parliament was decisively resolved in favor of Parliamentary sovereignty[cite: 805, 806]. It covers the transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy and the emergence of modern political structures[cite: 805, 806].</p>

    <h2 id="glorious-rev">1. The Glorious Revolution (1688)</h2>
    <p>The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, refers to the events that led to the overthrow of King James II and the accession of William III and Mary II to the throne[cite: 808].</p>

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Religious Conflict:</strong> James II was a Roman Catholic who favored Catholics for high offices, alarming the Protestant majority[cite: 808].</li>
        <li><strong>Political Absolutism:</strong> The King frequently bypassed Parliament, used the "suspending power" to ignore laws, and maintained a standing army in peacetime[cite: 808].</li>
        <li><strong>Birth of an Heir:</strong> The birth of a son to James II's Catholic queen threatened a permanent Catholic dynasty in England[cite: 808].</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Events and Outcome</h3>
    <p>Prominent Protestant leaders invited William of Orange (from the Netherlands) to "save" England[cite: 808]. William landed at Torbay; James II fled to France after his army deserted him[cite: 808]. Because there was no major battle within England, it is often called the "Bloodless Revolution"[cite: 808].</p>

    <h2 id="bill-of-rights">2. The Bill of Rights (1689)</h2>
    <p>The Bill of Rights is one of the most important documents in British constitutional history, laying down the limits on the powers of the monarch[cite: 809].</p>

    <h3>Key Provisions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parliamentary Sovereignty:</strong> The monarch cannot suspend laws or levy taxes without the consent of Parliament[cite: 809].</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> Members of Parliament were guaranteed freedom of speech during debates[cite: 809].</li>
        <li><strong>Rights of Subjects:</strong> Guaranteed the right to petition the monarch and prohibited "cruel and unusual punishments"[cite: 809].</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Parliaments:</strong> Parliament must be held frequently to address grievances[cite: 809].</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        Formula for Constitutional Balance: King + Parliament = Sovereignty.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="act-settlement">3. The Act of Settlement (1701)</h2>
    <p>This act was passed to secure the Protestant succession to the throne and further define the relationship between the crown and the law[cite: 810].</p>

    <h3>Main Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protestant Succession:</strong> Explicitly stated that any person who is a Catholic or married to a Catholic is excluded from the throne[cite: 810].</li>
        <li><strong>Judicial Independence:</strong> Judges' commissions were to be made during "good behavior" rather than at the King's pleasure, ensuring they could not be easily removed by the monarch[cite: 810].</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign Policy Restrictions:</strong> The monarch could not engage in war to defend foreign territories (like Hanover) without Parliamentary consent[cite: 810].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="william-foreign">4. Foreign Policy of William III</h2>
    <p>William III's foreign policy was primarily driven by his lifelong struggle to contain the expansionist ambitions of Louis XIV of France[cite: 811].</p>

    <h3>Key Aspects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Grand Alliance:</strong> William was the architect of a major European coalition (including England, the Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Empire) against France[cite: 811].</li>
        <li><strong>Nine Years' War (1688–1697):</strong> Aimed at preventing French dominance in Europe and securing the English throne from the Jacobite threat supported by France[cite: 811].</li>
        <li><strong>War of the Spanish Succession:</strong> William worked to prevent a union between the French and Spanish crowns, though the actual war began just after his death[cite: 811].</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="walpole-cabinet">5. Robert Walpole and the Cabinet System</h2>
    <p>Sir Robert Walpole is generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, serving from 1721 to 1742[cite: 812].</p>

    <h3>Emergence of the Cabinet</h3>
    <p>During the reign of George I, who spoke little English and was often in Hanover, the King stopped attending meetings of his inner council (the Cabinet)[cite: 812]. This allowed a senior minister to take the lead[cite: 812].</p>

    <h3>Walpole’s Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principle of Collective Responsibility:</strong> The idea that the Cabinet must present a united front to Parliament[cite: 812].</li>
        <li><strong>Link between Crown and Parliament:</strong> Walpole acted as the bridge, ensuring the King's business was done in the House of Commons while maintaining the King's favor[cite: 812].</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Stability:</strong> His "Quieta non movere" (Let sleeping dogs lie) policy focused on peace and trade to allow Britain's economy to grow[cite: 812].</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Exam Focus: Tips and FAQs</h4>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When writing about the Glorious Revolution, always emphasize that it was not just about changing the king, but about changing the *power* of the king relative to Parliament.

        <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Thinking the Bill of Rights gave everyone the right to vote. <strong>Correction:</strong> It established the rights of *Parliament* and some civil liberties, but the right to vote remained very restricted.</li>
            <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Assuming William III was English. <strong>Correction:</strong> He was the Dutch Prince of Orange and his primary interest remained European geopolitics[cite: 811].</li>
        </ul>
