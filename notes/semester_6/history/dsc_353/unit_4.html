    <p id="intro">The period between 1815 and 1878 was a defining era for British foreign policy. Following the defeat of Napoleon, Britain emerged as the world's leading power. Its policy shifted from a focus on European stability through collective security to a more assertive, independent, and eventually imperialistic approach. [cite: 826-832]</p>

    <h2 id="castlereagh">1. Lord Castlereagh (1812–1822)</h2>
    <p>Lord Castlereagh was the architect of British foreign policy in the immediate post-Napoleonic era. His primary goal was to ensure long-term peace in Europe through a "Balance of Power". [cite: 827-828]</p>

    <h3>Key Principles and Actions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Congress of Vienna (1815):</strong> He played a central role in redrawing the map of Europe. He sought to surround France with "buffer states" to prevent future aggression.</li>
        <li><strong>The Congress System:</strong> Castlereagh believed in "diplomacy by conference." He favored regular meetings between the Great Powers (Britain, Russia, Prussia, Austria) to resolve disputes collectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance of Power:</strong> He aimed to prevent any single nation from dominating the continent.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy of Non-Intervention:</strong> While he supported collective security, he increasingly resisted the attempts of the "Holy Alliance" (Russia, Prussia, Austria) to intervene in the internal affairs of other states to suppress revolutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="canning">2. George Canning (1822–1827)</h2>
    <p>George Canning succeeded Castlereagh and moved British policy toward a more liberal and independent direction, famously stating, "Every nation for itself, and God for us all." </p>

    <h3>Key Achievements and Shifts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Break with the Congress System:</strong> Canning disliked the idea of permanent European conferences and preferred independent British action.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for South American Independence:</strong> He recognized the independence of Spain's South American colonies to prevent a French-Spanish monopoly on trade, claiming he "called the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old."</li>
        <li><strong>Greek Independence:</strong> He shifted British policy to support the Greek revolt against the Ottoman Empire, leading to the eventual independence of Greece.</li>
        <li><strong>Portuguese Crisis:</strong> He sent British troops to Lisbon in 1826 to protect the constitutional government against a reactionary revolt, demonstrating his willingness to use force to support liberal interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="palmerston">3. Lord Palmerston (1830–1865)</h2>
    <p>Lord Palmerston dominated British foreign policy for over three decades. His approach was characterized by a robust defense of British interests and the use of "Gunboat Diplomacy." </p>

    <h3>Main Features of Palmerstonian Policy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Civis Romanus Sum":</strong> In the <strong>Don Pacifico Affair (1850)</strong>, he famously declared that every British subject should be protected by the British government wherever they were in the world, just as a Roman citizen had been.</li>
        <li><strong>Gunboat Diplomacy:</strong> He did not hesitate to use the Royal Navy to threaten or coerce other nations to respect British trade or citizens (e.g., during the Opium Wars in China).</li>
        <li><strong>Support for Liberalism:</strong> He generally supported constitutional movements in Europe (such as the 1848 revolutions) as long as they did not threaten the European balance of power.</li>
        <li><strong>The Eastern Question:</strong> He worked to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman Empire to prevent Russian expansion into the Mediterranean, which led to British involvement in the <strong>Crimean War (1853–1856)</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="disraeli">4. Benjamin Disraeli (1874–1880)</h2>
    <p>Benjamin Disraeli brought a new spirit of "Imperialism" to British foreign policy, focusing on the expansion and glorification of the British Empire. </p>

    <h3>Imperial and Strategic Maneuvers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Suez Canal Shares (1875):</strong> He acted quickly and secretly to purchase the Khedive of Egypt's shares in the Suez Canal, securing Britain's "highway to India."</li>
        <li><strong>Empress of India (1876):</strong> He passed the Royal Titles Act, granting Queen Victoria the title "Empress of India," which served as a symbol of imperial pride.</li>
        <li><strong>Congress of Berlin (1878):</strong> After a Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire, Disraeli successfully forced a revision of the peace terms. He secured <strong>Cyprus</strong> for Britain and checked Russian influence in the Balkans, returning to London claiming "Peace with Honour."</li>
        <li><strong>The Great Game:</strong> He pursued an aggressive policy in Afghanistan to counter Russian influence near the Indian border.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>5. Exam Corner</h4>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When writing about this period, focus on the <strong>transition</strong>. Castlereagh was about <em>order</em>, Canning was about <em>independence</em>, Palmerston was about <em>prestige and force</em>, and Disraeli was about <em>Empire</em>.
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse <strong>non-intervention</strong> with <strong>isolationism</strong>. Britain was always deeply involved in European affairs, but the leaders differed on *how* and *when* to intervene in the internal politics of other nations.
