    <p>This unit examines the profound socioeconomic changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent political shifts, including the landmark Reform Act of 1832 and the rise of organized labor movements.</p>

    <h2 id="ind-rev-factors">1. Factors behind the Occurrence of the Industrial Revolution in England</h2>
    <p>The Industrial Revolution began in England around the mid-18th century due to a unique combination of geographical, political, and economic factors.</p>

    <h3>Key Factors for England's Lead:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Geographical Advantage:</strong> England had abundant natural resources, particularly coal and iron ore, which were essential for steam engines and machinery. Its damp climate was also ideal for textile production.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability of Capital:</strong> Profits from global trade and colonial ventures provided the necessary investment for new technologies and factories.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Stability:</strong> Unlike continental Europe, England enjoyed long periods of internal peace and a stable government that protected private property and encouraged commerce.</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific and Technical Innovation:</strong> A culture of practical experimentation led to inventions like the steam engine, spinning jenny, and power loom.</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural Revolution:</strong> Improved farming techniques increased food production with less labor, creating a surplus population that migrated to cities to work in factories.</li>
        <li><strong>Vast Colonial Markets:</strong> Britain’s expansive empire provided both cheap raw materials and a ready market for finished industrial goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ind-rev-causes">2. Industrial Revolution: Causes and Effects</h2>
    <p>The transition from manual labor and animal power to machine-based manufacturing redefined global society.</p>

    <h3>Primary Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technological Breakthroughs:</strong> James Watt’s improvement of the <strong>steam engine</strong> enabled factories to be built away from rivers, leading to urban industrial centers.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> The construction of canals, improved roads (macadamization), and later railways revolutionized transportation and trade.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth of the Factory System:</strong> Centralized production replaced the domestic "putting-out" system, allowing for mass production and lower costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Effects:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Rapid growth of industrial cities like Manchester and Birmingham, often resulting in overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Britain became the "workshop of the world," leading to unprecedented national wealth and the rise of a powerful middle class (bourgeoisie).</li>
        <li><strong>Social Stratification:</strong> A clear divide emerged between the wealthy factory owners and the impoverished industrial working class.</li>
        <li><strong>Labor Conditions:</strong> Early industrial life was marked by long hours (12–16 hours a day), low wages, and the widespread use of child labor in dangerous environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Massive coal consumption led to severe air and water pollution in industrial districts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="reform-act">3. Reform Act of 1832</h2>
    <p>The Reform Act of 1832 was a landmark piece of legislation that addressed the outdated electoral system in Britain.</p>

    <h3>Need for Reform:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Rotten Boroughs":</strong> Depopulated areas still sent representatives to Parliament, while growing industrial cities like Manchester had no representation.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrow Franchise:</strong> Only a tiny fraction of the male population had the right to vote.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Main Provisions of the Act:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Redistribution of Seats:</strong> 143 seats were taken from "rotten" or small boroughs and given to new industrial towns and large counties.</li>
        <li><strong>Extension of the Franchise:</strong> The right to vote was extended to middle-class men who owned or rented property of a certain value (the "10-pound householders").</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Electorate:</strong> The number of voters increased by about 50%, though the working class was still largely excluded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance:</h3>
    <p>While it was not a democratic revolution, it was a crucial step in breaking the monopoly of the landowning aristocracy and integrating the industrial middle class into the political system.</p>

    <h2 id="working-class">4. Working Class Movement</h2>
    <p>Discontent over poor working conditions and exclusion from the Reform Act of 1832 led to the rise of organized working-class movements.</p>

    <h3>Key Movements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trade Unionism:</strong> Workers formed unions to collectively bargain for better wages and safer conditions. Despite initial legal bans (Combination Acts), unions eventually gained recognition.</li>
        <li><strong>Luddism:</strong> A movement of textile workers who protested against new machinery that threatened their livelihoods by smashing machines.</li>
        <li><strong>Chartism (1838–1848):</strong> The first large-scale working-class political movement.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>The People's Charter:</strong> The Chartists demanded six points:
        1. Universal male suffrage
        2. Secret ballot
        3. No property qualification for MPs
        4. Payment for MPs
        5. Equal electoral districts
        6. Annual Parliaments
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <p>Although Chartism failed to achieve its immediate goals, almost all its demands (except annual parliaments) were eventually adopted in the 19th and 20th centuries, laying the foundation for modern British democracy.</p>

        <h2>5. Exam Corner</h2>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When discussing the <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong>, always distinguish between the <em>domestic system</em> (work at home) and the <em>factory system</em> (centralized production). This is a common comparison asked in exams.
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not say the 1832 Reform Act gave the "common man" the vote. It primarily benefited the <strong>middle class</strong>. The working class remained disenfranchised until later reforms.
