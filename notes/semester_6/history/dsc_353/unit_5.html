    <p>This final unit explores the aggressive expansion of the British Empire in Africa, the strategic diplomatic shifts that ended Britain's "Splendid Isolation," and the escalating tensions that led to the First World War [cite: 834-840].</p>

    <h2 id="africa-expansion">1. British Expansion in Africa: Egypt and Sudan</h2>
    <p>During the late 19th century, Britain played a dominant role in the "Scramble for Africa," focusing on strategic control of the Nile route.</p>

    <h3>Egypt: The Suez Canal Lifeline</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strategic Importance:</strong> The Suez Canal (opened 1869) shortened the route to India significantly. Britain viewed control of Egypt as essential to protect this "Imperial Lifeline."</li>
        <li><strong>Disraeli's Masterstroke (1875):</strong> Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli secretly purchased the Khedive of Egypt's shares in the Suez Canal, giving Britain a major stake in its management.</li>
        <li><strong>Occupation (1882):</strong> Following a nationalist revolt led by Ahmed Urabi, British forces bombarded Alexandria and occupied Egypt. Though theoretically part of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt became a <em>de facto</em> British protectorate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sudan: The Mahdist War</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Mahdist Revolt:</strong> A religious and nationalist movement led by the "Mahdi" (Muhammad Ahmad) challenged Egyptian and British control in Sudan.</li>
        <li><strong>Fall of Khartoum (1885):</strong> The siege of Khartoum and the death of General Charles Gordon was a massive public humiliation for the British government.</li>
        <li><strong>Reconquest (1898):</strong> General Herbert Kitchener led a modern army to defeat the Mahdist forces at the <strong>Battle of Omdurman</strong>. Sudan was subsequently administered as an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="anglo-japan">2. Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902</h2>
    <p>The 1902 alliance was a revolutionary shift in British foreign policy, marking the formal end of "Splendid Isolation".</p>

    <h3>Causes and Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Containment of Russia:</strong> Both Britain and Japan were alarmed by Russian expansion in the Far East (Manchuria and Korea).</li>
        <li><strong>Naval Overstretch:</strong> Britain needed a partner in the Pacific so it could concentrate its fleet in European waters to counter the rising German navy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If either nation were at war with <em>one</em> other power, the other would remain neutral.</li>
        <li>If either nation were at war with <em>two or more</em> powers, the other was bound to join the conflict.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="germany-rivalry">3. Germany's Rivalry with Britain: The Morocco Crises</h2>
    <p>The early 20th century saw a dangerous escalation of tension between Britain and Germany, primarily due to colonial disputes and a naval arms race.</p>

    <h3>The Naval Race</h3>
    <p>The introduction of the <strong>HMS Dreadnought</strong> (1906) by Britain made all existing battleships obsolete. Germany's attempt to match British naval strength created deep-seated hostility.</p>

    <h3>The Morocco Crises:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First Morocco Crisis (1905):</strong> Kaiser Wilhelm II visited Tangier to challenge French influence. Britain supported France, strengthening the newly formed <em>Entente Cordiale</em> and isolating Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Morocco Crisis / Agadir Incident (1911):</strong> Germany sent the gunboat <em>Panther</em> to the port of Agadir. Britain again stood firmly with France, signaling that it would not allow Germany to dictate European affairs through "Gunboat Diplomacy."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ww1-entry">4. Britain's Entry into the First World War</h2>
    <p>The immediate trigger for British involvement was the violation of neutral territory in Western Europe.</p>

    <h3>The Chain of Events:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Alliance Web:</strong> The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered the alliance systems of Europe.</li>
        <li><strong>The Schlieffen Plan:</strong> Germany's military plan required invading neutral <strong>Belgium</strong> to reach France quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Treaty of London (1839):</strong> Britain was a signatory to this treaty, which guaranteed Belgian neutrality.</li>
        <li><strong>Declaration of War:</strong> When Germany ignored the British ultimatum to withdraw from Belgium, Britain declared war on August 4, 1914.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ww1-role">5. Role of England in the First World War</h2>
    <p>Great Britain provided the financial, naval, and industrial backbone of the Allied effort.</p>

    <h3>Military and Naval Contribution:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Naval Blockade:</strong> The Royal Navy's blockade of German ports was a decisive factor in starving the German economy and military of resources.</li>
        <li><strong>The BEF:</strong> The British Expeditionary Force played a critical role in stopping the initial German advance at the Battle of the Marne.</li>
        <li><strong>Kitchener’s Army:</strong> Britain successfully raised a massive volunteer army (and later implemented conscription) to fight on the Western Front.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Home Front:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Total War:</strong> The government took unprecedented control over the economy via the <em>Defence of the Realm Act</em> (DORA).</li>
        <li><strong>Changing Status of Women:</strong> Women entered factories, transit, and agriculture in massive numbers, which was a primary catalyst for the post-war extension of voting rights.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>6. Exam Corner</h2>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When discussing the <strong>Anglo-Japanese Alliance</strong>, always explain why it was a "Diplomatic Revolution." It broke the long-held tradition of Britain staying out of permanent peacetime alliances.
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not assume Britain entered WWI purely to help Serbia. The primary legal and strategic reason was the <strong>violation of Belgian neutrality</strong> and the threat of German control over the English Channel.
