    [cite_start]<p>This unit examines a transformative era in British history marked by the loss of the first colonial empire, the ideological challenge of the French Revolution, and the decisive struggle against Napoleonic France, alongside the spiritual revival of Methodism [cite: 814-818].</p>

    <h2 id="american-war">1. Britain and the War of American Independence</h2>
    <p>The American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) was a global conflict that pitted Great Britain against its thirteen North American colonies and their European allies.</p>

    <h3>Causes of the War</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Taxation without Representation:</strong> Britain imposed heavy taxes (e.g., Stamp Act, Tea Act) to pay for the Seven Years' War, which the colonists resisted because they lacked representation in the British Parliament.</li>
        <li><strong>Restrictions on Trade:</strong> The Navigation Acts restricted American trade to benefit British merchants.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Ideology:</strong> The spread of Enlightenment ideas regarding liberty and self-governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Britain Lost</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Distance and Logistics:</strong> Britain struggled to supply an army 3,000 miles across the Atlantic.</li>
        <li><strong>French and Spanish Intervention:</strong> The entry of France (1778) and Spain into the war turned a colonial revolt into a global naval war that stretched British resources thin.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Local Support:</strong> Britain overestimated the strength of "Loyalists" within the colonies.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h3>Consequences for Britain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Treaty of Paris (1783):</strong> Britain formally recognized American independence.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of the First Empire:</strong> The loss of the American colonies marked the end of the "First British Empire."</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Shift:</strong> Britain shifted its focus toward trade with the East (India and China), leading to the "Second British Empire."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="french-rev">2. Impact of the French Revolution on Britain</h2>
    <p>The outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 sent shockwaves through British society, polarizing political thought.</p>

    <h3>Intellectual and Political Response</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Edmund Burke:</strong> In his <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>, he argued for conservative stability and warned that sudden radical changes would lead to chaos and tyranny.</li>
        <li><strong>Thomas Paine:</strong> In <em>The Rights of Man</em>, he defended the revolution and called for democratic reforms in Britain.</li>
        <li><strong>Government Reaction:</strong> Fearing a similar revolt, William Pitt the Younger’s government suppressed radical groups, suspended <em>Habeas Corpus</em>, and introduced "Gagging Acts."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="napoleonic">3. England in the Napoleonic Wars</h2>
    <p>Britain was the most persistent opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte, leading several coalitions to prevent French hegemony in Europe.</p>

    <h3>The Struggle at Sea</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Battle of Trafalgar (1805):</strong> Admiral Lord Nelson achieved a decisive naval victory, annihilating the combined French and Spanish fleets. This ensured British naval supremacy for over a century.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Economic Warfare</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Continental System:</strong> Napoleon attempted to cripple Britain by banning European trade with her.</li>
        <li><strong>British Orders in Council:</strong> Britain responded with its own naval blockade, which ultimately proved more effective and damaged the European economy more than the British one.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Final Defeat</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Battle of Waterloo (1815):</strong> The Duke of Wellington led an allied army to the final defeat of Napoleon, leading to a long period of British-led peace in Europe (the Pax Britannica).</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="methodist">4. The Methodist Movement</h2>
    <p>The 18th century saw a significant religious revival within the Church of England, led by John and Charles Wesley.</p>

    <h3>Origins and Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>John Wesley:</strong> Emphasized personal piety, methodical study of the Bible, and preaching to the masses, often in the open air.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Methodism reached the working classes who felt neglected by the formal Church of England. It encouraged sobriety, hard work, and education.</li>
        <li><strong>Organisational Strength:</strong> The movement used "societies" and "circuits" with lay preachers to spread its message rapidly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preventing Revolution?</strong> Some historians argue that Methodism’s focus on spiritual salvation and social discipline helped prevent the spread of revolutionary radicalism among the British working classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Institutional Change:</strong> Although it began as a movement within the Anglican Church, Methodism eventually became a separate denomination.</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When discussing why Britain lost the American War, always emphasize the role of the <strong>French Navy</strong>. Without French naval support, the Americans likely would not have won at Yorktown.
