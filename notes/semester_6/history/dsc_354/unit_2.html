    <p>This unit delves into the philosophical and methodology-based foundations of history. It explores how historians explain why events happen (causation), the challenges of remaining impartial (objectivity), and how history borrows from and contributes to other social science disciplines.</p>

    <h2 id="causation">1. Causation in History: Concept and Debate</h2>
    <p>Causation is the process by which one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect). History is not just a collection of "what" happened, but an investigation into "why" it happened.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts of Causation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiple Causation:</strong> Historians generally agree that no single cause explains a major event. For example, the French Revolution was caused by social inequality, economic crisis, and Enlightenment ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchy of Causes:</strong> Historians distinguish between *primary* (major) causes and *secondary* (minor) causes.</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate vs. Remote Causes:</strong> An immediate cause is the trigger (e.g., the assassination at Sarajevo for WWI), while remote causes are long-term tensions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Debate:</h3>
    <p>Some historians argue for <strong>Determinism</strong> (events are inevitable results of prior causes), while others emphasize the <strong>Role of the Individual</strong> and <strong>Chance</strong> in shaping history.</p>

    <h2 id="objectivity">2. Objectivity in History: Concept and Debate</h2>
    <p>Objectivity refers to the historian’s ability to provide a fair, accurate, and impartial account of the past without letting personal feelings or biases influence the work.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "The historian must present the past as it really was." — Leopold von Ranke.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Challenges to Objectivity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Bias:</strong> A historian’s religion, nationality, or political leanings may unconsciously cloud their judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability of Sources:</strong> If sources only exist from one perspective (e.g., the victors), the history will be inherently one-sided.</li>
        <li><strong>Selectivity:</strong> By choosing which facts to include and which to ignore, a historian creates a specific narrative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="social-sciences">3. History and other Social Sciences</h2>
    <p>History is often called the "Mother of all Social Sciences" because it provides the temporal (time-based) context for all human behavior.</p>

    <div class="add-horizontal-scroll"><table>
        <tr>
            <th>Discipline</th>
            <th>Relationship with History</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Commonality</strong></td>
            <td>Both study human society and behavior using systematic evidence.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Difference</strong></td>
            <td>Social sciences often focus on general patterns and laws, while history focuses on specific, unique events in time.</td>
        </tr>
    </table></div>

    <h2 id="interdisciplinary">4. Specific Interdisciplinary Relations</h2>
    <p>The modern historian must work with various specialized fields to reconstruct a complete picture of the past.</p>

    <h3>a) History and Archaeology</h3>
    <p>History provides the narrative; Archaeology provides the physical proof (monuments, pottery, tools). This is especially vital for ancient periods where written records are missing.</p>

    <h3>b) History and Anthropology</h3>
    <p>Anthropology studies the culture and biological evolution of humans. History uses this to understand the origins of customs, myths, and social behaviors.</p>

    <h3>c) History and Sociology</h3>
    <p>Sociology studies social structures and institutions. History provides the long-term data on how these institutions (like family or caste) have changed over centuries.</p>

    <h3>d) History and Economics</h3>
    <p>Economic forces (trade, taxes, production) are often the root cause of historical change. <strong>Marxist Historiography</strong> is based entirely on the economic interpretation of history.</p>

    <h3>e) History and Political Science</h3>
    <p>History is the record of past politics; Political Science is the study of current power structures based on historical precedents.</p>

    <h3>f) History and Geography</h3>
    <p>Geography provides the physical stage (mountains, rivers, climate) where history is played out. For example, Britain’s island geography allowed it to develop a strong navy and avoid many land invasions.</p>

        <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thematic Link:</strong> When writing about interdisciplinary relations, use the phrase: "History is the root, and the other social sciences are the fruit".</li>
            <li><strong>Objectivity Debate:</strong> Mention that while "absolute" objectivity might be impossible, "procedural" objectivity (using fair methods) is the historian's duty.</li>
        </ul>

                <td>How is History related to Sociology?</td>
                <td>Sociology provides the concepts of social order, while History provides the evolution of that order.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Is complete objectivity possible?</td>
                <td>It is highly debated; most believe historians should strive for it while acknowledging their inherent perspectives.</td>
