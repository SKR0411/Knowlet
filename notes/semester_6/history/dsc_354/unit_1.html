    <p>This unit introduces the academic discipline of Historiography, which is the study of how history is written. It explores the evolving definitions of history, its status as an academic field, and the various raw materials (sources) used to reconstruct the past.</p>

    <h2 id="definition">1. History: Definitions, Nature, and Scope</h2>
    <p>The word 'History' is derived from the Greek word <strong>'Historia'</strong>, meaning inquiry or knowledge acquired by investigation.</p>

    <h3>Definitions of History</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>E.H. Carr:</strong> Defined history as a "continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts, an unending dialogue between the present and the past."</li>
        <li><strong>G.R. Elton:</strong> Viewed history as an objective study of the past based on the critical evaluation of evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Lord Acton:</strong> Defined it as the record of the "growth of freedom."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Nature of History</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> History is not a dead subject; it changes as new evidence is discovered or as historians apply new perspectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretative:</strong> History is not just a list of names and dates; it involves analyzing the 'why' and 'how' behind events.</li>
        <li><strong>Universal:</strong> History covers all aspects of human activity—political, social, economic, and cultural.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scope of History</h3>
    <p>The scope of history is as vast as the history of mankind itself. It has expanded from being purely political (wars and kings) to including the lives of common people, women, the environment, and science.</p>

    <h2 id="science-lit">2. The Debate: History as Science vs. History as Literature</h2>
    <p>Historians have long debated the exact status of their discipline.</p>

    <h3>History as Science</h3>
    <p>Many scholars, particularly in the 19th century, argued that history should be treated as a science.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>J.B. Bury:</strong> Famously stated that "History is a science, no less and no more."</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Methods:</strong> Like scientists, historians use systematic methods: collecting data, testing the authenticity of sources, and formulating hypotheses based on facts.</li>
        <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> The goal is to remain impartial and present the past "as it actually was" (Leopold von Ranke).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>History as Literature</h3>
    <p>Other scholars argue that history belongs to the humanities and is a branch of literature.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrative Form:</strong> History is written in a story format (narrative). The quality of the writing determines how well the message is conveyed.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Reconstruction:</strong> Because historians cannot perform laboratory experiments, they must use "historical imagination" to fill gaps in the record.</li>
        <li><strong>Moral Lessons:</strong> Literature aims to teach or move the reader; similarly, history often seeks to provide lessons or inspiration.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Modern historiography generally views history as a <em>Social Science</em>—using scientific methods of research while employing literary techniques for presentation.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="sources">3. Sources of History</h2>
    <p>Sources are the raw materials used by historians to reconstruct the past. Without sources, there is no history.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="sub-sources">4. Classification of Historical Sources</h2>
    <p>The syllabus categorizes sources into several distinct types:</p>

    <h3>A. Literary Sources</h3>
    <p>These are written records including books, diaries, and religious texts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Religious Literature:</strong> Vedas, Puranas, Jataka stories which provide cultural context.</li>
        <li><strong>Secular Literature:</strong> Biographies (e.g., Harshacharita) and administrative manuals (e.g., Arthashastra).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Archaeological Sources</h3>
    <p>These are physical remains of the past.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Epigraphy:</strong> The study of <strong>Inscriptions</strong> found on stones, copper plates, and temple walls. These are considered the most reliable sources for dates and names.</li>
        <li><strong>Numismatics:</strong> The study of <strong>Coins</strong>. They reveal information about the economy, the extent of an empire, and the religious beliefs of the rulers.</li>
        <li><strong>Material Remains:</strong> Pottery, tools, jewelry, and ruins of buildings (e.g., Harappa, Nalanda).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Foreign Sources</h3>
    <p>Accounts written by travelers, pilgrims, and ambassadors from other countries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Megasthenes (Greek), Hiuen Tsang (Chinese), Ibn Battuta (Moroccan). They provide an "outside" perspective, though they may contain misunderstandings of local culture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Archival Sources</h3>
    <p>Official government documents, reports, and records kept in national or state archives. These are vital for studying modern history and colonial administration.</p>

    <h2 id="exam-corner" class="exam-section">5. Exam Corner</h2>

    <div class="exam-tip">
        <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When discussing "History as Science," always mention <strong>J.B. Bury</strong> and <strong>Leopold von Ranke</strong>. When discussing the "unending dialogue," mention <strong>E.H. Carr</strong>. These names carry significant weight in historiography papers.
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Do not confuse "History" with "Historiography." History is the study of the past; Historiography is the study of <em>how</em> the past has been written and interpreted by various scholars.
