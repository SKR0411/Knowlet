    <p>This unit examines the evolution of historical writing across different civilizations and eras. We trace the journey from the inquisitive foundations of the Greeks to the analytical rigor of the Romans, the theological interpretations of the Middle Ages, and the socio-scientific innovations of the Arab world [cite: 869-876].</p>

    <h2 id="greek">1. Greek Historiography: Herodotus and Thucydides</h2>
    <p>The Greeks were the first to move history away from myth and toward a human-centered investigation (Historia)[cite: 871].</p>

    <h3>Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE)</h3>
    <p>Commonly known as the <strong>"Father of History"</strong>, Herodotus laid the groundwork for historical inquiry.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Work:</strong> <em>The Histories</em>, which primarily records the causes and events of the Persian Wars.</li>
        <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> He relied on personal observation (Autopsia), oral traditions, and interviews. He aimed to preserve the memory of great deeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Style:</strong> Narrative and inclusive, often including geographic and ethnographic details of the people he visited.</li>
        <li><strong>Weakness:</strong> He occasionally included legends and supernatural elements, though he often noted his skepticism toward them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Thucydides (c. 460–400 BCE)</h3>
    <p>Known as the <strong>"Father of Scientific History"</strong>, he introduced a stricter level of analytical rigor[cite: 871].</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Work:</strong> <em>History of the Peloponnesian War</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Emphasized eyewitness testimony and the critical evaluation of documents. He excluded the intervention of gods entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> He sought to explain the political and military logic of war to provide lessons for future generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Concept:</strong> <em>The Thucydides Trap</em>—the idea that war becomes inevitable when a rising power threatens a dominant one.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="roman">2. Roman Historiography: Livy and Tacitus</h2>
    <p>Roman historiography was deeply tied to the identity and political morality of the Roman State[cite: 872].</p>

    <h3>Livy (59 BCE – 17 CE)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Work:</strong> <em>Ab Urbe Condita</em> (From the Founding of the City).</li>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> He wrote with a <strong>patriotic and moral purpose</strong>. He used history to celebrate Roman virtues and warn against moral decay.</li>
        <li><strong>Style:</strong> Focus on great individuals and dramatic narratives. He was less concerned with critical research than with creating an inspiring national story.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tacitus (c. 56 – 120 CE)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Works:</strong> <em>The Annals</em> and <em>The Histories</em>[cite: 872].</li>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> A critical and often pessimistic observer of the Roman Empire. He analyzed the corrupting nature of power and the loss of Roman liberty.</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> Renowned for his deep <strong>psychological insight</strong> into the motives of leaders and his concise, forceful prose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="church">3. Church Historiography: St. Augustine</h2>
    <p>During the Middle Ages, history became a branch of theology, focusing on God's plan for humanity[cite: 874].</p>

    <h3>St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Work:</strong> <em>De Civitate Dei</em> (The City of God)[cite: 874].</li>
        <li><strong>Providential History:</strong> He argued that history is the unfolding of a divine plan. Every event, including the fall of Rome, has a religious significance.</li>
        <li><strong>Linear Time:</strong> Unlike the Greek/Roman view of cyclical time (rise and fall of empires), Augustine introduced a <strong>linear view of time</strong>: from Creation to the Day of Judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Dualism:</strong> History is a struggle between the "City of God" (spiritual/eternal) and the "City of Man" (material/temporal).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="arab">4. Arab Historiography: Ibn Khaldun</h2>
    <p>Medieval Arab historiography reached its intellectual peak by incorporating social sciences into the study of the past[cite: 876].</p>

    <h3>Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406 CE)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Work:</strong> <em>The Muqaddimah</em> (The Introduction to History)[cite: 876].</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Approach:</strong> He is often considered the <strong>Father of Sociology and Historiography</strong> in the modern sense. He argued that history must analyze the underlying social and economic causes of events.</li>
        <li><strong>Asabiyyah (Social Cohesion):</strong> His central theory explains the rise and fall of civilizations based on the strength of social solidarity within a group.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyclical Theory:</strong> He described a pattern where nomadic groups with high <em>asabiyyah</em> conquer settled empires, only to lose their cohesion through luxury over generations, eventually being conquered themselves.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>5. Exam Corner</h4>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When writing about <strong>Greek Historiography</strong>, always compare Herodotus and Thucydides. One is the storyteller (Father of History), and the other is the analyst (Father of Scientific History).

        <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Assuming Thucydides and Herodotus had the same style. <strong>Correction:</strong> Herodotus included myths and geography; Thucydides focused strictly on politics and evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Viewing St. Augustine's work as purely secular. <strong>Correction:</strong> It is primarily a theological defense of Christianity using historical examples.</li>
        </ul>
