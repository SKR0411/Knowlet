    <p>This unit tracks the evolution of historical writing in India from the colonial period to the present day. It examines how different schools of thought interpreted India's past to serve varied political, social, and ideological goals.</p>

    <h2 id="imperialist">1. Imperialist (Colonial) Historiography</h2>
    <p>This school was pioneered by British officials and scholars who wrote about India during the colonial era to justify British rule.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>James Mill:</strong> In his <em>History of British India</em> (1817), he divided Indian history into Hindu, Muslim, and British periods. He portrayed pre-British India as stagnant and backward.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Viewed Indian society as unchangeable and "despotic."</li>
                <li>Argued that India lacked a sense of history or nationality.</li>
                <li>Presented British rule as a "civilizing mission."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="nationalist">2. Nationalist Historiography</h2>
    <p>Emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this school was a response to colonial distortions. Indian historians sought to restore national pride.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> R.G. Bhandarkar, K.P. Jayaswal, and R.C. Majumdar.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Challenged the notion that India was always "uncivilized."</li>
                <li>Highlighted the "Golden Age" of ancient India (e.g., the Gupta Empire).</li>
                <li>Emphasized traditional Indian values, democracy in ancient republics, and cultural unity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2 id="marxist">3. Marxist Historiography in India</h2>
    <p>Post-independence, a group of historians applied the principles of Historical Materialism to the Indian context, moving the focus from "kings" to "modes of production."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> D.D. Kosambi, R.S. Sharma, and Romila Thapar.</li>
        <li><strong>D.D. Kosambi:</strong> His work <em>An Introduction to the Study of Indian History</em> shifted focus toward the peasantry, land relations, and social transitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed history through class struggle and economic structures.</li>
                <li>Criticized the "Golden Age" narrative of nationalists as being unscientific.</li>
                <li>Explored the transition from tribalism to feudalism in India.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="subaltern">4. Subaltern Studies</h2>
    <p>Beginning in the 1980s, this school aimed to write history "from below," focusing on those ignored by elite colonial or nationalist narratives.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Figure:</strong> Ranajit Guha (founder of the Subaltern Studies collective).</li>
        <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Focuses on peasants, workers, tribal communities, and women.</li>
                <li>Argues that the subaltern classes had their own independent political consciousness, separate from elite leadership (like the Congress).</li>
                <li>Uses non-traditional sources to uncover the "voice" of the marginalized.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

            <li><strong>Q: Why is James Mill criticized by modern historians?</strong><br>
            A: For his communal division of history and his biased view of Indian culture as "backward."</li>
            <li><strong>Q: What is the main objective of the Subaltern school?</strong><br>
            A: To restore the agency and history of the marginalized groups who were overlooked by traditional historians.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="quote">"History is the memory of states." — This perspective was challenged by the Subaltern school which believes history belongs to the people, not just the state.</p>
