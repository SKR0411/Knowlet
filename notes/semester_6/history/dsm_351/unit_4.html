    <p>This unit examines the decade of the 1930s—a period marked by economic collapse and the failure of international diplomacy, which collectively dismantled the post-WWI peace and led directly to the Second World War.</p>

    <h2 id="depression">1. The Great Economic Depression (1929)</h2>
    <p>Triggered by the Wall Street Crash in the USA, the Depression became a global phenomenon, devastating European economies that were still recovering from WWI.</p>

    

    <h3>Impact on Europe:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Germany:</strong> Unemployment reached 6 million; the middle class lost their savings, providing a fertile ground for the Nazi Party's rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Shift:</strong> Many people lost faith in democracy and turned toward radical ideologies (Communism or Fascism) for solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Nationalism:</strong> Countries introduced high tariffs to protect their own industries, which paralyzed international trade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="spanish-war">2. The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)</h2>
    <p>Often called a <strong>"Dress Rehearsal for WWII,"</strong> this conflict saw a struggle between the Republican government and Nationalist rebels led by General Francisco Franco.</p>

    

    <h3>International Significance:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ideological Battle:</strong> It was a war between Democracy/Socialism (Republicans) and Fascism (Nationalists).</li>
        <li><strong>Intervention:</strong> Hitler and Mussolini sent troops and planes to support Franco; Stalin supported the Republicans. Britain and France remained neutral.</li>
        <li><strong>Military Testing:</strong> The German <em>Luftwaffe</em> tested its "Blitzkrieg" tactics, notably in the bombing of the town of Guernica.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="appeasement">3. The Policy of Appeasement</h2>
    <p>Appeasement was the diplomatic policy followed by Britain and France in the 1930s, involving making concessions to Hitler to avoid another general war.</p>

    <h3>The Munich Pact (1938):</h3>
    <p>This was the height of Appeasement. Britain (Chamberlain) and France agreed to let Hitler annex the <strong>Sudetenland</strong> from Czechoslovakia.</p>

    

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Historical View:</strong> Critics argued that Appeasement only emboldened Hitler, convincing him that the Western powers were too weak to fight.
    </div>

    <h2 id="russo-german">4. The Russo-German Non-Aggression Pact</h2>
    <p>In August 1939, two ideological enemies—Hitler and Stalin—signed a secret pact that shocked the world.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Agreement:</strong> They promised not to attack each other for 10 years.</li>
        <li><strong>The Secret Protocol:</strong> They agreed to divide Poland and the Baltic states between themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>The Result:</strong> Hitler was now free to invade Poland without fearing a two-front war with the USSR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Analysis: Why did WWII start?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Failure of the League:</strong> It could not stop Japan, Italy, or Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>Harshness of Versailles:</strong> Created a desire for revenge in Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeasement:</strong> Allowed Hitler to grow too strong to be stopped peacefully.</li>
    </ul>
