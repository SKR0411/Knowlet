    <p>This unit examines the final phase of Japan's imperial trajectory, focusing on the internal collapse of civilian government, the aggressive expansion into China, and the catastrophic involvement in the global conflict of the Second World War [cite: 780-783].</p>

    <h2 id="militarism">1. Rise of Militarism in Japan</h2>
    <p>The 1930s saw Japan move away from "Taisho Democracy" toward a military-dominated government.</p>

    <h3>Factors for the Rise:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Great Depression:</strong> Economic collapse led to poverty, particularly in rural areas, making the military's promise of expansion for resources more appealing.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure of Party Politics:</strong> Corruption scandals in political parties and their inability to handle the economic crisis led to public disillusionment.</li>
        <li><strong>Military Autonomy:</strong> The Meiji Constitution allowed the military to report directly to the Emperor, bypassing the civilian cabinet.</li>
        <li><strong>Assassinations:</strong> Right-wing officers assassinated key political figures, including Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi (May 15 Incident), effectively ending civilian control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sino-war">2. 2nd Sino-Japanese War 1937: Causes and Effects</h2>
    <p>The conflict that began in 1937 was a full-scale invasion of China by the Japanese Empire.</p>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Marco Polo Bridge Incident (1937):</strong> A minor skirmish between Japanese and Chinese troops near Beijing served as the pretext for a full-scale invasion.</li>
        <li><strong>Desire for Resources:</strong> Japan sought to secure North China's raw materials (coal, iron) to support its industrial and military needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-Communism:</strong> Japan viewed China's Nationalist government (KMT) and the rising Communists as a threat to its regional dominance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Effects:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Atrocities:</strong> The "Rape of Nanking" (1937) resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and mass sexual violence, drawing international condemnation.</li>
        <li><strong>Stalemate:</strong> Despite superior technology, Japan could not achieve a decisive victory over the vast Chinese territory, leading to a long, draining war of attrition.</li>
        <li><strong>U.S. Tension:</strong> The invasion led to increasing friction with the United States, which began providing aid to China.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="ww2-joining">3. Japan's Joining the Second World War: Circumstances</h2>
    <p>Japan's entry into the global war was driven by strategic isolation and the need for essential resources.</p>

    <h3>Key Circumstances:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Tripartite Pact (1940):</strong> Japan joined Germany and Italy in the Axis alliance, aiming to deter the United States.</li>
        <li><strong>The U.S. Oil Embargo:</strong> In response to Japan's occupation of French Indochina, the U.S. froze Japanese assets and cut off oil exports.</li>
        <li><strong>The Decision for War:</strong> Depleted of oil, the Japanese military decided to seize the resource-rich "Southern Resource Area" (Southeast Asia).</li>
        <li><strong>Pearl Harbor (Dec 7, 1941):</strong> Japan launched a surprise attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet to prevent American interference in its Southeast Asian conquests.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        War logic = Resources needed for China war - U.S. Embargo + Opportunity in Southeast Asia = Strike at Pearl Harbor.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="ww2-role">4. Role of Japan in Second World War</h2>
    <p>Japan's war effort spanned across the Pacific and Southeast Asia.</p>

    <h3>Phase 1: Expansion (1941-1942)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conquests:</strong> Rapidly seized the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies.</li>
        <li><strong>Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere:</strong> A propaganda concept promoting Asian independence from Western imperialism, though in reality, it was a Japanese colonial system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phase 2: Turning Point and Retreat (1942-1945)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Battle of Midway (1942):</strong> A crushing naval defeat for Japan that stopped its eastward expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>Island Hopping:</strong> U.S. forces systematically captured strategic islands, moving closer to the Japanese home islands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phase 3: The End</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Aug 1945):</strong> The U.S. dropped atomic bombs on these cities, leading to unprecedented destruction.</li>
        <li><strong>Soviet Entry:</strong> The USSR declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria.</li>
        <li><strong>Surrender:</strong> Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945, ending WWII.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Critical Distinction:</strong> Always distinguish between the 1st Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), which was for Korea, and the 2nd Sino-Japanese War (1937-45), which was a full-scale invasion of China.

        <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Thinking Japan was forced into the war by Germany. <strong>Correction:</strong> Japan's decision for war was based primarily on its own resource crisis and imperial ambitions in China.</li>
            <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Forgetting the role of the <strong>Great Depression</strong> in causing militarism. <strong>Correction:</strong> Economic misery was the primary internal trigger that allowed the military to seize political power.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mnemonic: The Fall of Imperial Japan (A.B.C.D. Encirclement)</h3>
        <p>Remember the powers that Japan felt were encircling it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A</strong> - <strong>A</strong>mericans</li>
            <li><strong>B</strong> - <strong>B</strong>ritish</li>
            <li><strong>C</strong> - <strong>C</strong>hinese</li>
            <li><strong>D</strong> - <strong>D</strong>utch</li>
        </ul>
