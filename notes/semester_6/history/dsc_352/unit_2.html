    <p>Following the restoration of imperial rule, Japan embarked on a rapid journey to modernize its internal structures. This unit examines the economic transformations and the legal framework that turned Japan into a centralized, modern military and economic power.</p>

    <h2 id="economic-dev">1. Economic Development in the Meiji Era</h2>
    <p>The Meiji government aimed to transform Japan's feudal economy into a modern industrial capitalist system to resist Western encroachment.</p>

    <h2 id="agrarian">2. Agrarian Settlement</h2>
    <p>Agriculture was the backbone of the initial modernization phase, providing the necessary revenue for state-led industrialization.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Land Tax Reform (1873):</strong> The government implemented a uniform land tax paid in cash rather than rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Farmers were recognized as the legal owners of their land through land deeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue Stability:</strong> This settlement provided a stable and predictable source of income for the government to fund infrastructure and the military.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="industrial">3. Industrialization and Capitalism</h2>
    <p>Japan adopted the slogan <strong>"Fukoku Kyohei"</strong> (Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Military).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>State-Led Industry:</strong> The government initially built and operated model factories in textiles, mining, and shipbuilding.</li>
        <li><strong>Zaibatsu:</strong> In the 1880s, the state sold many of these industries to private entrepreneurs at low prices, leading to the rise of massive industrial conglomerates known as <em>Zaibatsu</em> (e.g., Mitsubishi, Mitsui).</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Rapid construction of railroads, telegraph lines, and the establishment of a modern banking system supported capitalist growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="women">4. Women's Rights in the Meiji Era</h2>
    <p>The Meiji era saw contradictory developments regarding the status and rights of women.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> The government promoted basic education for girls to create "Good Wives and Wise Mothers".</li>
        <li><strong>Labor:</strong> Women provided the bulk of the labor force in the vital silk and textile factories that fueled Japan's early economic rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Limitations:</strong> Despite their economic contribution, women were officially barred from joining political parties or attending political meetings until much later.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="constitution">5. The Meiji Constitution (1889-90)</h2>
    <p>The Meiji Constitution was a gift from the Emperor to the people, intended to define Japan as a modern nation in Western eyes while preserving traditional imperial authority.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Imperial Sovereignty:</strong> The Emperor was defined as sacred and inviolable, holding supreme command of the army and navy.</li>
        <li><strong>The Diet:</strong> A bicameral legislature was established, consisting of the House of Peers (appointed) and the House of Representatives (elected by a limited male electorate).</li>
        <li><strong>Cabinet:</strong> Ministers were responsible to the Emperor, not to the Diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Rights of Citizens:</strong> Basic rights like freedom of speech and religion were granted, but "within the limits of the law".</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="exam-corner" class="exam-tip">6. Exam Focus</h2>
    <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Understand the role of <strong>"Zaibatsu"</strong> in Japan's transition to industrial capitalism.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Be ready to discuss how the Meiji Constitution balanced <strong>Western political models</strong> with <strong>traditional Japanese values</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't forget that agriculture initially paid for the industrialization through the land tax reform.</li>
    </ul>
