    <p>This unit provides a comprehensive understanding of Japan's transition from a feudal society under the Tokugawa Shogunate to a modernized, centralized state in response to 19th-century imperialist threats.</p>

    <h2 id="shogunate">1. Decline of the Shogunate</h2>
    <p>The Tokugawa Shogunate, which had ruled Japan since 1603, began to weaken significantly by the mid-19th century.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Factors of Decline:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Crisis:</strong> Financial difficulties plagued the samurai and daimyo classes, while the merchant class grew in wealth but lacked political power.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Unrest:</strong> Frequent peasant uprisings and samurai discontent weakened the central authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Fragmentation:</strong> Powerful regional domains, particularly Satsuma and Choshu, began to challenge the Shogun's authority.</li>
        <li><strong>External Pressure:</strong> The arrival of Western "Black Ships" exposed Japan's military technological backwardness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="perry">2. U.S.-Japan Relations: Perry Mission and Treaty of Kanagawa</h2>
    <p>Japan's policy of isolation (Sakoku) was forcibly ended by the United States in the 1850s.</p>

    <h3>The Perry Mission (1853-54)</h3>
    <p>Commodore Matthew Perry arrived with a fleet of modern warships, demanding that Japan open its ports for trade and the protection of shipwrecked American sailors.</p>

    <h3>The Treaty of Kanagawa (1854)</h3>
    <p>Facing overwhelming military force, the Shogunate signed Japan's first treaty with a Western power.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Port Opening:</strong> Japan agreed to open the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American ships.</li>
        <li><strong>Consular Rights:</strong> The U.S. was allowed to establish a consulate in Japan.</li>
        <li><strong>End of Isolation:</strong> This treaty marked the beginning of "unequal treaties" and the total abandonment of isolationism.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2 id="restoration">3. The Meiji Restoration of 1868</h2>
    <p>The Meiji Restoration was a political revolution that brought about the final demise of the Tokugawa Shogunate and restored imperial rule under Emperor Meiji.</p>

    <h3>The Outbreak</h3>
    <p>Internal conflict between pro-Shogunate forces and pro-Imperial forces (Satsuma-Choshu alliance) culminated in the Boshin War. The Shogun resigned, and a centralized government was established in Tokyo (formerly Edo).</p>

    <h3>Major Changes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Abolition of Feudalism:</strong> The feudal domains (han) were replaced by prefectures under central control.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Equality:</strong> The rigid class system was abolished, and the samurai class lost its special privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>Modernization:</strong> Japan adopted Western technology, education, and military systems to build a "Rich Country, Strong Army" (Fukoku Kyohei).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="nature">4. Nature of the Restoration</h2>
    <p>The nature of the Meiji Restoration is a subject of historical debate, as it combined both revolutionary and conservative elements.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Revolutionary</strong></td>
            <td>It completely dismantled the 250-year-old feudal system and class structure.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Conservative</strong></td>
            <td>It was led by low-ranking samurai from within the existing system and restored the ancient institution of the Emperor.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Top-Down</strong></td>
            <td>Unlike the French Revolution, this was an "Elite Revolution" driven by a small group of reformers rather than a mass peasant uprising.</td>
        </tr>

    <div id="exam-prep" class="exam-tip">
        <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> In your answers, always link the <strong>Perry Mission</strong> as the catalyst that triggered internal Japanese crises, leading directly to the <strong>Meiji Restoration</strong>.
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not assume the Restoration happened overnight. It was a complex process of political maneuvering and civil war that took place over several years.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What was the main goal of the Meiji reformers?</strong><br>
        To modernize Japan quickly to prevent it from becoming a colony of Western powers.</li>
        <li><strong>Why was the Treaty of Kanagawa called an "unequal treaty"?</strong><br>
        Because it granted extraterritoriality and favorable trade terms to the U.S. while offering no reciprocal benefits to Japan.</li>
    </ul>
