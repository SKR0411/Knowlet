    <p>This unit explores Japan's aggressive foreign policy in the early 20th century, its participation in the global diplomatic arena, and the systemic failures that led to its militarization.</p>

    <h2 id="korea">1. Japan's Relation with Korea (1870-1905)</h2>
    <p>Japan viewed Korea as a "dagger pointed at its heart" and sought to eliminate Chinese and Russian influence over the peninsula.</p>

    <h3>Key Diplomatic and Military Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Treaty of Kanghwa (1876):</strong> Japan used "gunboat diplomacy" to force Korea to open three ports and declare itself independent from Chinese tributary status.</li>
        <li><strong>First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95):</strong> Japan defeated China, leading to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which formally recognized Korean independence (a prerequisite for Japanese control).</li>
        <li><strong>The Russo-Japanese War (1904-05):</strong> Following victory over Russia, Japan established a <strong>protectorate</strong> over Korea via the Eulsa Treaty.</li>
        <li><strong>Annexation:</strong> The process culminated in 1910 with the formal annexation of Korea into the Japanese Empire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ww1">2. Japan in WWI: The 21 Demands</h2>
    <p>When World War I broke out in Europe, Japan seized the opportunity to expand its influence in East Asia while the Western powers were distracted.</p>

    <h3>Participation in the War</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Japan honored the <strong>Anglo-Japanese Alliance</strong> and declared war on Germany in 1914.</li>
        <li>It quickly seized German-held territories in China (Shantung Peninsula) and the Pacific islands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The 21 Demands (1915)</h3>
    <p>Japan presented a secret ultimatum to China, divided into five groups, aimed at turning China into a Japanese protectorate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Group 1-4:</strong> Demanded recognition of Japanese rights in Shantung, Manchuria, and Inner Mongolia.</li>
        <li><strong>Group 5 (The most controversial):</strong> Required China to hire Japanese political, financial, and military advisors. This group was later dropped due to international outcry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="washington">3. The Washington Conference (1921-22)</h2>
    <p>The Washington Conference was an attempt by Western powers to curb Japanese naval expansion and maintain the status quo in the Pacific.</p>

    <h3>Major Treaties:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Four-Power Treaty:</strong> Britain, USA, France, and Japan agreed to respect each other's Pacific territories and ended the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Five-Power Naval Treaty:</strong> Set a ratio for capital ships. Japan was limited to a ratio of 3 compared to 5 for the USA and Britain (5:5:3).</li>
        <li><strong>Nine-Power Treaty:</strong> Reaffirmed the "Open Door Policy" in China and guaranteed Chinese territorial integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        The 5:5:3 Ratio became a symbol of national humiliation for Japanese militarists, who felt Japan was being treated as a second-class power.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="manchuria">4. The Manchurian Crisis (1931)</h2>
    <p>The Manchurian Crisis marked the end of international cooperation and the beginning of Japan's path toward World War II.</p>

    <h3>The Mukden Incident</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Kwantung Army</strong> (Japanese forces in Manchuria) staged a small explosion near a Japanese-owned railway line and blamed Chinese dissidents. Without authorization from the civilian government in Tokyo, the army invaded and occupied Manchuria.</p>

    <h3>Consequences:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manchukuo:</strong> Japan established a puppet state in Manchuria with the last Qing Emperor, Pu Yi, as the figurehead.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure of the League of Nations:</strong> China appealed to the League. The Lytton Commission condemned Japan, but the League had no power to enforce its decision.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933, signaling its rejection of the international order.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chronology:</strong> Always remember the sequence: 21 Demands (WWI) -> Washington Conference (Curbs expansion) -> Manchurian Crisis (Breakout).</li>
            <li><strong>Key Terms:</strong> Use terms like <em>Kwantung Army</em> and <em>Lytton Commission</em> to score higher in the Manchurian Crisis section.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pitfall">
            <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not say that the Japanese government ordered the invasion of Manchuria. It was an act of "independent" military officers, highlighting the loss of civilian control over the military.
