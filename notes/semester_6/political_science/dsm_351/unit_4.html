        <h2>1. Political Party Systems</h2>
        <p>Political parties are the primary vehicles for organizing public opinion and contesting power. The nature of the party system often depends on the electoral rules of the country.</p>

        <h3>A. Britain: Two-Party Dominance</h3>
        <p>Although Britain has many parties, its system is described as a <strong>Two-Party System</strong> because power usually rotates between two major parties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conservative Party (Tories):</strong> Right-leaning, focuses on free-market economics and traditional values.</li>
            <li><strong>Labour Party:</strong> Left-leaning, focuses on workers' rights and social welfare.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Third Parties:</strong> Parties like the Liberal Democrats often act as "kingmakers" in rare hung-parliament scenarios.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Brazil: Multiparty Fragmentation</h3>
        <p>Brazil has an <strong>Extremely Fragmented Multiparty System</strong>. It is common to have dozens of parties represented in the National Congress.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ideological Flux:</strong> Parties often form around personalities rather than fixed ideologies.</li>
            <li><strong>Coalition Presidentialism:</strong> Because no single party ever wins a majority, the President must form large, often unstable coalitions to pass laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Major Parties:</strong> PT (Workers' Party), PL (Liberal Party), and MDB (Brazilian Democratic Movement).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block" id="pressure_groups">
        <h2>2. Pressure Groups and Interest Groups</h2>
        <p>Pressure groups (also called Interest Groups) do not contest elections but seek to influence government policy from the outside.</p>

        <h3>Britain: Pluralist Lobbying</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sectional Groups:</strong> Represent specific sections of society (e.g., British Medical Association, Trade Unions).</li>
            <li><strong>Promotional Groups:</strong> Promote a specific cause (e.g., Greenpeace, Amnesty International).</li>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> In the UK, groups often have direct links to government departments and provide expert advice during the drafting of bills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Brazil: Corporatism and Social Movements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>History of Corporatism:</strong> Historically, the state had strong control over unions and business associations.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Movements:</strong> Brazil has powerful grassroots movements that function as pressure groups, such as the <strong>MST (Landless Workers' Movement)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Lobbying:</strong> While present, it is often seen as less institutionalized than in the Westminster system.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>

    <div class="content-block" id="electoral_systems">
        <h2>3. Electoral Systems: FPTP vs. Proportional Representation</h2>
        <p>The "rules of the game" determine how votes are converted into seats, which in turn determines the type of party system that emerges.</p>

        <h3>A. First Past The Post (FPTP) - Britain</h3>
        <p>Used for the House of Commons. The candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins, even if they don't have a majority (50%+).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Usually leads to a stable, single-party government.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Disproportional results; small parties are under-represented.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>B. Proportional Representation (PR) - Brazil</h3>
        <p>Used for the Chamber of Deputies. Seats are assigned to parties in proportion to the total number of votes they receive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Highly representative; every vote counts toward a seat.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Leads to many small parties, making it difficult to form a stable government.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duverger's Law:</strong> Mention this! It states that FPTP systems tend to lead to two-party systems, while PR leads to multiparty systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Coalition Presidentialism:</strong> This is a key term for Brazil. It explains why a President with a personal mandate can still be "weak" if they can't manage the many parties in Congress.</li>
                <li><strong>Hung Parliament:</strong> Define this when discussing the UK—a situation where no single party wins a majority of seats.</li>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Why is Brazil's party system so fragmented?</strong><br>
            A: Mainly because of the Proportional Representation system and the ease with which politicians can switch parties (party infidelity).</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the main role of pressure groups in the UK?</strong><br>
            A: They provide expert information to civil servants and MPs, and they mobilize public opinion to influence specific policy changes.</p>
