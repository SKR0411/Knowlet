            <h2>1. Comparative Politics: Meaning, Nature, and Scope</h2>
        </span>
        <p><strong>Comparative Politics</strong> is a major subfield of Political Science that involves the study and comparison of domestic politics, institutions, and processes across different countries. While "Comparative Government" traditionally focused on formal legal structures, "Comparative Politics" includes informal actors like interest groups, political culture, and social movements.</p>
        
        <h3>Nature of the Discipline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytical and Empirical:</strong> It doesn't just describe; it analyzes <em>why</em> political systems differ.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Coverage:</strong> Includes both Western and non-Western systems (Global South).</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Processes:</strong> Studies how power is actually exercised, not just how laws are written.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope has expanded from the mere study of 19th-century European constitutions to including modern phenomena like <strong>globalization</strong>, <strong>ethnic conflicts</strong>, and <strong>transnational terrorism</strong>. It covers the executive, legislature, judiciary, political parties, and voting behavior.</p>

    <div class="content-block" id="comp_evolution">
        <span id="spap_evolution">
            <h2>2. Evolution and Significance</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The study of comparative politics has evolved through several distinct phases:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional Phase (Aristotle to 19th Century):</strong> Focused on normative and legalistic study of governments. Aristotle is the "Father" of this field for comparing 158 Greek city-state constitutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Phase (Post-WWII):</strong> Shifted toward <em>Behavioralism</em>. Scholars began studying the "Global South" (Asia and Africa) and used scientific methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Modern Phase:</strong> Focuses on themes like democratization, sustainable development, and identity politics.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>It helps us understand our own political system better by comparing it with others, provides a basis for political theory, and allows for the prediction of political trends.</p>

            <h2>3. Comparing Regimes: Democratic vs. Authoritarian</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Regimes are classified based on who holds power and how they exercise it.</p>

        <h3>Monarchy vs. Republic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monarchy:</strong> Head of state is a hereditary ruler (e.g., UK, Saudi Arabia).</li>
            <li><strong>Republic:</strong> Head of state is elected, directly or indirectly (e.g., India, USA).</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>4. Classifications of Political Systems</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Political systems are categorized based on the relationship between the organs of government and the distribution of power.</p>
        
        <h3>A. Parliamentary vs. Presidential</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parliamentary:</strong> The executive is part of the legislature and responsible to it (e.g., India, UK). Dual executive (Head of State vs. Head of Government).</li>
            <li><strong>Presidential:</strong> Separation of powers. The executive is independent of the legislature (e.g., USA, Brazil). Single executive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Federal vs. Unitary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Federal:</strong> Constitutional division of power between Central and Regional governments (e.g., USA, India - "Quasi-federal").</li>
            <li><strong>Unitary:</strong> All powers are concentrated in the hands of the Central government; regional units exist at its mercy (e.g., UK, France).</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aristotle's Contribution:</strong> Mention Aristotle's comparison of 158 constitutions to score high marks in "History/Evolution."</li>
                <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Use terms like <em>Empirical, Behavioralism, Non-reciprocity</em> (in context of regionalism if relevant), and <em>Separation of Powers</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Distinction:</strong> Clearly distinguish between "Government" (the body) and "Politics" (the activity).</li>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the main difference between Comparative Government and Comparative Politics?</strong><br>
            A: Comparative Government is narrow and legalistic; Comparative Politics is broader, including the study of political behavior and informal institutions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Is India a true Federation?</strong><br>
            A: India is often described as "Quasi-federal" (K.C. Wheare) because it has a strong centralizing tendency despite having federal features.</p>
