            <h2>1. From Absolutism to Constitutionalism: The British Case</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The British political system is unique because it lacks a single codified document. Its transition from <strong>Absolute Monarchy</strong> (where the King had total power) to <strong>Constitutional Monarchy</strong> (where the Monarch's power is limited by law and Parliament) happened over centuries through evolution, not a single revolution.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Constitutionalism?</h3>
        <p>Constitutionalism is the principle that government authority is derived from and limited by a body of fundamental law. In Britain, this means the <strong>"Rule of Law"</strong> and <strong>"Parliamentary Sovereignty."</strong></p>

        

        <h3>Key Features of the British Transition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gradualism:</strong> Changes occurred slowly without violent upheavals (except the Civil War period).</li>
            <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Old institutions (like the Monarchy) were preserved but their functions changed.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The unwritten nature of the constitution allows it to adapt to modern needs easily.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>3. Colonialism and Decolonization: The Case of Brazil</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Unlike many other nations, Brazil's path to independence and modern government was heavily influenced by its unique relationship with its colonizer, <strong>Portugal</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>The Colonial Era (1500-1822)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Portuguese Rule:</strong> Brazil was the only major South American colony ruled by Portugal.</li>
            <li><strong>The Flight of the Monarchy (1808):</strong> When Napoleon invaded Portugal, the Portuguese Royal family fled to Brazil, making Rio de Janeiro the capital of the entire Portuguese Empire. This raised Brazil's status.</li>
        </ul>

        

        <h3>The Path to Independence</h3>
        <p>Independence was declared in <strong>1822</strong> by Dom Pedro I (the son of the Portuguese King), who became the first Emperor of Brazil. This made Brazil an <strong>Independent Empire</strong> before it became a Republic.</p>
    </div>

        <span id="brazil_republic">
            <h2>4. Transition to Republic in Brazil</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Brazil transitioned from a Monarchy to a Republic in <strong>1889</strong> through a military coup, marking the end of the "Empire of Brazil."</p>

        <h3>Phases of Governance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Empire (1822-1889):</strong> A period of relative stability but with a centralized monarchy.</li>
            <li><strong>The Old Republic:</strong> Characterized by the dominance of rural elites (the "Coffee with Milk" politics).</li>
            <li><strong>The Era of Dictatorship (1964-1985):</strong> A period of military rule that deeply affected modern Brazilian political culture.</li>
            <li><strong>Redemocratization (1985-Present):</strong> The 1988 Constitution established Brazil as a Federal Republic with strong democratic protections.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>5. Exam Focus: Tips and FAQs</h2>
        </span>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Unwritten" vs "Uncodified":</strong> Always use "Uncodified" for the British Constitution. It's more accurate because laws <em>are</em> written, just not in one single book.</li>
                <li><strong>The 1808 Event:</strong> Mentioning the Portuguese Royal family's move to Brazil is a "pro-tip" that shows you understand why Brazil's independence was different from Spanish colonies.</li>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> In Britain, remember that <strong>Parliament</strong> is sovereign. In Brazil (and India), the <strong>Constitution</strong> is sovereign.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Why is the British Constitution called a "living organism"?</strong><br>
            A: Because it is constantly growing and changing through new laws, court judgments, and conventions without needing formal amendments.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What was "Coffee with Milk" (Café com Leite) politics in Brazil?</strong><br>
            A: It was a political agreement between the elites of São Paulo (coffee producers) and Minas Gerais (dairy producers) to rotate the Presidency between them.</p>
