            <h2>1. Environmental Issues: Climate Change</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Climate change is arguably the most significant non-traditional security threat in global politics today. It refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like the burning of fossil fuels, which produce greenhouse gases.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Political Aspects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Tragedy of the Commons:</strong> A situation where individual states act in their own interest, depleting shared resources (like a clean atmosphere) to the detriment of the whole world.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> The measurable increase in the Earth's average temperature, leading to melting ice caps and rising sea levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Injustice:</strong> The reality that the poorest nations (who contribute the least to emissions) often suffer the most from climate-related disasters.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>

    <div class="content-block" id="int_agreements">
        <span id="spap_agreements">
            <h2>2. Major Environmental Agreements</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Since the 1990s, the international community has established several frameworks to coordinate a global response to environmental degradation.</p>

        <h3>The Evolution of Climate Diplomacy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UNFCCC (1992):</strong> The <em>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</em>, signed at the Rio Earth Summit. It set the stage for all future climate negotiations.</li>
            <li><strong>Kyoto Protocol (1997):</strong> The first agreement to set <strong>legally binding</strong> emission reduction targets for developed countries. It introduced the principle of <em>Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Paris Agreement (2015):</strong> A landmark treaty where nearly every nation agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C (preferably 1.5°C) above pre-industrial levels.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="content-block" id="poverty">

            <h2>3. Global Poverty: Definition and Challenges</h2>
        </span>
        <p>In global politics, poverty is no longer defined just by a lack of money (income poverty). It is viewed as a <strong>multi-dimensional deprivation</strong> of the capability to live a healthy, productive life.</p>

        <h3>Perspectives on Poverty</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute Poverty:</strong> A condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation, and shelter.</li>
            <li><strong>Relative Poverty:</strong> A situation where people lack the minimum amount of income needed to maintain the average standard of living in the society in which they live.</li>
            <li><strong>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</strong> Goal 1 of the UN's SDGs aims to "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block" id="inequality">
        <span id="spap_inequality_gap">
            <h2>4. Global Inequality: The North-South Divide</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Global inequality refers to the uneven distribution of resources, wealth, and power across the globe. This is most famously described as the <strong>North-South Divide</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Brandt Line</h3>
        <p>The "Global North" generally includes the rich, industrialized nations of Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, while the "Global South" includes the developing nations of Africa, Latin America, and developing Asia.</p>
        

        <h3>Factors Driving Inequality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Colonial Legacy:</strong> Historical exploitation that left many Southern nations with weak economies and infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Trade Barriers:</strong> Unfair global trade rules that often favor the products and services of wealthy nations.</li>
            <li><strong>Debt Burden:</strong> Developing nations often spend more on servicing international debt than on health or education.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>5. Exam Focus: Tips and FAQs</h2>
        </span>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CBDR:</strong> Always explain <em>Common But Differentiated Responsibilities</em> in questions about climate change. It is the core of the debate between the North and South.</li>
                <li><strong>SDGs vs MDGs:</strong> Note that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015.</li>
                <li><strong>Multidimensionality:</strong> When writing about poverty, emphasize that it includes lack of <em>education, healthcare, and political voice</em>, not just low income.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the 'Tragedy of the Commons'?</strong><br>
            A: It is an economic and political theory where individuals, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting a shared resource.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Why is the Global South more vulnerable to climate change?</strong><br>
            A: Because of geographical locations (prone to extreme weather), heavy reliance on agriculture, and lack of financial resources to build resilient infrastructure.</p>
