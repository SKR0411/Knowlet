            <h2>1. The United Nations (UN): Origin and Role</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The United Nations is the most prominent intergovernmental organization in the world. It was established on <strong>October 24, 1945</strong>, as a successor to the failed League of Nations, with the primary aim of preventing future world wars.</p>

        <h3>Primary Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peace and Security:</strong> Preventing conflicts and mediating between warring nations.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Rights:</strong> Protecting fundamental freedoms globally through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</li>
            <li><strong>International Law:</strong> Providing a legal framework for global cooperation.</li>
            <li><strong>Social and Economic Development:</strong> Addressing poverty, hunger, and climate change.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>2. The Principal Organs of the UN</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The UN operates through six main bodies, each with distinct functions:</p>

        

        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Assembly (UNGA):</strong> The main deliberative body. Every member state has one vote. It discusses global issues but its resolutions are generally <em>not binding</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Council (UNSC):</strong> Responsible for world peace. It has 15 members: 5 Permanent (P5) with <strong>Veto Power</strong> and 10 non-permanent members. Its resolutions are <em>legally binding</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC):</strong> Coordinates the economic and social work of the UN and its specialized agencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Secretariat:</strong> The administrative branch, headed by the <strong>Secretary-General</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>International Court of Justice (ICJ):</strong> The "World Court" that settles legal disputes between states. Based in The Hague, Netherlands.</li>
            <li><strong>Trusteeship Council:</strong> Created to oversee "Trust Territories." It is currently inactive as all territories have gained independence.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

            <h2>3. The Need for UN Reforms</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The world of 2026 is very different from 1945. There is growing pressure to reform the UN, especially the <strong>Security Council</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Key Areas of Reform</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expansion of UNSC:</strong> Developing nations from the Global South (like India, Brazil, and South Africa) demand permanent seats to reflect modern reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Veto Power:</strong> Many argue that the Veto power of the P5 often leads to a deadlock during major crises (e.g., Syria, Ukraine).</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Reform:</strong> Reducing the reliance on a few wealthy nations for funding to ensure the UN's independence.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block" id="bretton_woods">
        <span id="spap_economics">
            <h2>4. Bretton Woods Institutions: IMF and World Bank</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Created in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference, these two institutions manage the global financial and economic order.</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Role</strong></td>
                <td>Acts as a "Global Central Bank" to help countries in financial crisis.</td>
                <td>Provides long-term loans for infrastructure, health, and education.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Lending</strong></td>
                <td>Short-term loans for <em>Balance of Payments</em> problems.</td>
                <td>Long-term loans for development projects.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>

        <h3>Criticisms</h3>
        <p>Both institutions are often criticized for their <strong>"Conditionality"</strong>—forcing poor countries to adopt specific economic policies (like privatization) in exchange for loans, often harming the poor.</p>

            <h3>Exam Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The P5:</strong> Remember the five permanent members of the UNSC: USA, Russia, China, UK, and France. They are the only ones with the Veto.</li>
                <li><strong>ICJ Location:</strong> Note that the ICJ is the only major UN organ <em>not</em> located in New York; it is in The Hague.</li>
                <li><strong>IMF vs World Bank:</strong> Do not confuse them. If the question is about a <em>financial crisis</em>, think IMF. If it's about building a <em>bridge or school</em>, think World Bank.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the Veto Power?</strong><br>
            A: It is the power of a permanent member of the UNSC to stop any resolution from passing, even if all other 14 members agree with it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Why is the UN considered weak by some?</strong><br>
            A: Because it lacks its own army and depends on member states for funding and troops. It also cannot interfere in the "internal affairs" of a sovereign state easily.</p>
