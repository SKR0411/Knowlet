            <h2>1. Recombinant DNA: Concept and Process</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Recombinant DNA (rDNA) is a form of artificial DNA that is created by combining two or more sequences that would not normally occur together. It is the cornerstone of modern genetic engineering and gene cloning.</p>
        
        <h3>The General Process of Creating rDNA</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Extracting the target DNA (gene of interest) and the vector DNA.</li>
            <li><strong>Digestion:</strong> Cutting both the target and vector DNA with the same <strong>Restriction Endonuclease</strong> to create compatible "sticky" or "blunt" ends.</li>
            <li><strong>Ligation:</strong> Joining the two DNA molecules together using the enzyme <strong>DNA Ligase</strong> to form a single recombinant molecule.</li>
        </ol>
        
    </section>

    <section>
        <span id="spap_transformation">
            <h2>2. Bacterial Transformation and Selection of Clones</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Once the recombinant DNA is created, it must be introduced into a host cell, usually <em>E. coli</em>, to be copied (cloned).</p>

        <h3>Bacterial Transformation</h3>
        <p>This is the process by which bacteria take up foreign DNA from their environment. Cells are made "competent" through chemical treatment (e.g., Calcium Chloride) followed by a brief <strong>Heat Shock</strong>, which creates temporary pores in the cell membrane.</p>

        <h3>Selection of Recombinant Clones</h3>
        <p>Not every bacterial cell will take up a plasmid, and not every plasmid will contain the target gene. Selection is necessary to identify the successful clones.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antibiotic Resistance:</strong> Using antibiotic-containing media to kill cells that did not take up the plasmid (which carries resistance genes like <em>ampR</em>).</li>
            <li><strong>Blue-White Screening:</strong> A technique where successful insertion of the target gene disrupts a reporter gene (like <em>lacZ</em>), causing successful recombinants to appear as white colonies instead of blue.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            <h2>3. PCR Mediated Gene Cloning</h2>
        </span>
        <p>The <strong>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</strong> can be used to specifically amplify a gene of interest before it is inserted into a vector, making the cloning process much more efficient.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps in PCR</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Denaturation:</strong> Heating the DNA to ~94°C to separate the strands.</li>
            <li><strong>Annealing:</strong> Cooling to ~55°C to allow primers to bind to specific sequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Heating to ~72°C for <strong>Taq Polymerase</strong> to synthesize new DNA strands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In cloning, primers are often designed to include restriction sites, allowing the amplified product to be easily digested and ligated into a vector.</p>

            <h2>4. Construction of Genomic and cDNA Libraries</h2>
        </span>
        <p>A DNA library is a collection of cloned DNA fragments that together represent an entire genome or the expressed genes of a cell.</p>

        <h3>Genomic Library</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Total genomic DNA.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> Contains all DNA sequences, including exons, introns, and non-coding regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Genomic DNA is digested and fragments are ligated into high-capacity vectors like BACs or YACs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>cDNA Library</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Messenger RNA (mRNA) extracted from a specific tissue.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> Represents only the genes being expressed (active) at that time; does not contain introns.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> mRNA is converted into double-stranded "complementary DNA" (cDNA) using the enzyme <strong>Reverse Transcriptase</strong> before being cloned.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <span id="spap_screening">
            <h2>5. Screening DNA Libraries</h2>
        </span>
        <p>Once a library is created, it must be searched (screened) to find the specific clone containing the gene of interest.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic Selection:</strong> Designing the experiment so that only cells containing the desired gene can survive (e.g., providing a gene that fixes a nutritional deficiency in the host).</li>
            <li><strong>Colony Hybridization:</strong> Using a labeled DNA or RNA "probe" that is complementary to the target gene. The probe binds (hybridizes) to the target DNA in the specific colony that contains it.</li>
            <li><strong>PCR Screening:</strong> Using gene-specific primers to identify which pool of clones contains the target sequence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Exam Focus: Tips and FAQs</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Understand the difference between Genomic and cDNA libraries clearly. Genomic libraries are the same for every cell in an organism, but a cDNA library varies depending on the tissue and the time it was collected.
        </div>

        <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Mistake:</em> Thinking PCR creates recombinant DNA. <em>Correction:</em> PCR only <strong>amplifies</strong> DNA; ligation is needed to make it recombinant.</li>
            <li><em>Mistake:</em> Assuming a cDNA library contains all the organism's genes. <em>Correction:</em> It only contains genes that were being transcribed into mRNA at the time of collection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: What is a "probe" in colony hybridization?</strong><br>
        A: A probe is a short, single-stranded DNA or RNA fragment that is labeled (with radioactivity or fluorescence) and has a sequence complementary to the gene being sought.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Why is Reverse Transcriptase used for cDNA libraries?</strong><br>
        A: Because libraries are made of DNA, but the starting material for a cDNA library is RNA. Reverse transcriptase is the only enzyme that can synthesize DNA using an RNA template.</p>
