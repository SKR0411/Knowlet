        <h2 id="topic3-1">Concepts of Igneous Petrology</h2>
        <p>Igneous petrology is the study of igneous rocks, which are rocks formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock (magma or lava).</p>
        
        <h3>Origin and Nature of Magma</h3>
        <p><strong>Magma</strong> is a complex, high-temperature fluid mixture of molten silicate rock, suspended solid crystals, and dissolved gases (volatiles). It originates from the partial melting of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.</p>
        <p>Melting is caused by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Decompression Melting:</strong> Reduced pressure lowers the melting point (occurs at mid-ocean ridges).</li>
            <li><strong>Flux Melting:</strong> Addition of volatiles (like H<sub>2</sub>O) lowers the melting point (occurs at subduction zones).</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Transfer:</strong> Rising magma melts surrounding crustal rock.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Heat Flow and Geothermal Gradients</h3>
        <p><strong>Heat flow</strong> is the movement of heat from the Earth's hot interior to the cooler surface. The <strong>Geothermal Gradient</strong> is the rate at which temperature increases with depth. On average, this is ~25-30°C per kilometer in the crust, but it varies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Gradient:</strong> Found in active tectonic areas (e.g., mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones), allowing melting at shallower depths.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Gradient:</strong> Found in stable continental interiors (cratons).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Geothermal gradients through time:</strong> The Earth was much hotter in the past (e.g., Archean). This meant geothermal gradients were steeper, allowing for more extensive melting and the formation of unique rocks (like Komatiites) that do not form today.</p>

        <h2 id="topic3-2">Processes of Differentiation and Evolution of Magma</h2>
        <p>Magma evolution, or <strong>magmatic differentiation</strong>, describes all processes by which a single parent magma can generate a variety of different igneous rocks. This is why a single magma chamber can produce basalt, andesite, and rhyolite.</p>
        
        <p>Key processes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fractional Crystallization:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the <strong>most important</strong> differentiation process.</li>
                    <li>As magma cools, high-temperature minerals (like olivine) crystallize first.</li>
                    <li>If these dense crystals settle out (a process called <strong>crystal settling</strong>), they are removed from the melt.</li>
                    <li>The remaining liquid is now "evolved" and has a different composition (e.g., it is more silica-rich). This process is described by Bowen's Reaction Series.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Magma Mixing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two chemically distinct magmas mix in a magma chamber.</li>
                    <li>This creates a new, hybrid magma with a composition intermediate between the two original magmas.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assimilation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hot magma melts and incorporates the surrounding "country rock" it intrudes.</li>
                    <li>This changes the magma's composition (e.g., a mafic magma assimilating felsic crust will become more felsic).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic3-3">Bowen's Reaction Principle and Reaction Series</h2>
        <p>Developed by N.L. Bowen, this is a model that describes the <strong>sequence in which minerals crystallize from a cooling mafic magma</strong>. It is the cornerstone of igneous petrology and explains fractional crystallization.</p>
        
        <p>The series has two branches that merge:</p>
        <h3>1. Discontinuous Series (Mafic Minerals)</h3>
        <p>A sequence of reactions where one mineral reacts with the melt to form the *next* mineral. The crystal structure changes at each step.</p>
        <p><strong>(High Temp) Olivine → Pyroxene → Amphibole → Biotite Mica (Low Temp)</strong></p>
        <p>If olivine is removed from the melt, it cannot react to form pyroxene, and the melt's composition changes.</p>

        <h3>2. Continuous Series (Plagioclase Feldspar)</h3>
        <p>A continuous reaction where one mineral (plagioclase) changes its composition as it cools. It does not change its crystal structure.</p>
        <p><strong>(High Temp) Ca-rich Plagioclase → Na-rich Plagioclase (Low Temp)</strong></p>

        <h3>3. Residual Melt (Lowest Temperature Crystallization)</h3>
        <p>After the main branches are complete, the remaining melt is highly evolved and rich in silica, K, and Na. These minerals crystallize last:</p>
        <p><strong>Potassium Feldspar (K-Feldspar) → Muscovite Mica → Quartz</strong></p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Importance of Bowen's Series:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>It explains <strong>magma differentiation</strong>.</li>
                <li>It explains <strong>mineral assemblages</strong> (why quartz and olivine are almost never found together in the same igneous rock).</li>
                <li>It predicts the <strong>order of weathering</strong> on Earth's surface (minerals at the top are least stable; minerals at the bottom are most stable).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3-4">IUGS Classification of Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p>The <strong>IUGS (International Union of Geological Sciences)</strong> provides a standardized system for classifying igneous rocks based on their <strong>modal mineralogy</strong> (the volume percentage of minerals present).</p>
        
        <h3>The QAPF Diagram</h3>
        <p>This is the most common IUGS classification, used for plutonic rocks. It is a diamond-shaped diagram based on the relative percentages of four mineral groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q</strong> = Quartz</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong> = Alkali Feldspar (K-Feldspar, Albite)</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong> = Plagioclase Feldspar</li>
            <li><strong>F</strong> = Feldspathoids (Silica-poor minerals. <strong>Q and F cannot co-exist</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The percentages of Q, A, P, and F are recalculated to sum to 100%. The rock's name is then determined by its position in one of the fields.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Granite:</strong> Rich in Q and A.</li>
            <li><strong>Diorite:</strong> Rich in P, little to no Q or A.</li>
            <li><strong>Syenite:</strong> Rich in A, very little Q.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3-5">Textures and Structures of Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p><strong>Texture</strong> refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral crystals in a rock. It tells us about the cooling history.</p>

        <h3>Textures (Grain Size)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phaneritic (Coarse-grained):</strong> Crystals are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. Indicates <strong>slow cooling</strong> (intrusive).</li>
            <li><strong>Aphanitic (Fine-grained):</strong> Crystals are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Indicates <strong>rapid cooling</strong> (extrusive).</li>
            <li><strong>Porphyritic:</strong> A mixed texture with large crystals (called <strong>phenocrysts</strong>) embedded in a fine-grained matrix (called <strong>groundmass</strong>). Indicates a two-stage cooling history (slow cooling first, then rapid cooling).</li>
            <li><strong>Glassy:</strong> No crystals formed. Indicates <strong>instantaneous cooling</strong> (e.g., obsidian).</li>
            <li><strong>Vesicular:</strong> Contains bubbles (vesicles) from escaping gases (e.g., pumice, scoria).</li>
            <li><strong>Pyroclastic:</strong> Composed of broken fragments of rock, glass, and minerals (e.g., tuff).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Structures</h3>
        <p>These are large-scale features in the rock body, often seen in the field.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pillow Structures:</strong> Rounded, pillow-shaped masses of basalt. Formed when lava erupts <strong>underwater</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Columnar Jointing:</strong> Polygonal columns (often 6-sided) formed by the contraction of cooling lava (e.g., Devil's Tower, Giant's Causeway).</li>
            <li><strong>Vesicles and Amygdales:</strong> Vesicles are gas bubbles. If they are later filled with secondary minerals (like calcite or quartz), they are called <strong>amygdales</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic3-6">Mode of Occurrence and Forms of Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p>This describes where and how igneous rocks form.</p>
        
        <h3>Extrusive (Volcanic) Forms</h3>
        <p>Form when lava cools <em>on</em> the Earth's surface.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lava Flows:</strong> Sheets of lava that flow over the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanoes:</strong> (e.g., Shield volcanoes, Stratovolcanoes).</li>
            <li><strong>Pyroclastic Deposits:</strong> Layers of ash and fragments from explosive eruptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Intrusive (Plutonic) Forms</h3>
        <p>Form when magma cools <em>beneath</em> the Earth's surface. They are classified by their relationship to the "country rock" (the pre-existing rock they intrude).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concordant:</strong> Intrusions that run parallel to the layers of the country rock.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sill:</strong> A tabular (sheet-like) intrusion that is parallel to the rock layers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laccolith:</strong> A mushroom-shaped intrusion that pushes the overlying rock layers upward.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Discordant:</strong> Intrusions that cut *across* the layers of the country rock.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dike:</strong> A tabular (sheet-like) intrusion that cuts across rock layers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Batholith:</strong> A very large (> 100 km² exposed area), irregularly shaped intrusion. They form the core of mountain ranges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stock:</strong> A smaller version of a batholith (< 100 km² exposed area).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
