        <p>This unit focuses on understanding the features and processes of river systems, which are a key part of interpreting landscapes in the field.</p>

        <h2 id="topic5-1">Meandering, Bank Erosion, and Ox-bow Lake Formation</h2>
        
        <h3>Meandering River</h3>
        <p>A <strong>meandering river</strong> is a river with a single, sinuous (winding) channel. These are common in low-gradient (flat) areas. The key to meandering is the flow dynamics within the channel.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thalweg:</strong> The path of deepest and fastest-flowing water in the river. In a meander, the thalweg swings to the <strong>outside</strong> of the bend.</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Erosion (Cut Bank):</strong> The fast-flowing water (thalweg) on the <strong>outer bank</strong> of a meander causes active erosion, forming a steep, unstable bank called a <strong>cut bank</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Deposition (Point Bar):</strong> The slower-moving water on the <strong>inner bank</strong> of a meander does not have enough energy to carry sediment, so it deposits sand and gravel, forming a gently sloping feature called a uploads (point bar)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This combined process of <strong>erosion on the outside</strong> and <strong>deposition on the inside</strong> causes the meander to migrate (move) and become more sinuous over time.</p>

        <h3>Ox-bow Lake Formation</h3>
        <p>An <strong>ox-bow lake</strong> is a U-shaped lake that is formed when a wide meander of a river is cut off.</p>
        
        <h4>The Process:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>High Sinuosity:</strong> A meander becomes very curved, and the two cut-banks (the "neck" of the meander) get closer and closer together.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut-off:</strong> During a flood, the river has high energy and takes the shortest path, breaking through the narrow neck. This is a <strong>neck cut-off</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Abandonment:</strong> The river now flows along this new, straighter, high-energy path. Sediment (silt and clay) is deposited at the "entrances" to the old, abandoned loop.</li>
            <li><strong>Ox-bow Lake:</strong> This sediment eventually plugs the old loop, separating it from the river and forming an independent, crescent-shaped lake.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic5-2">Floodplains</h2>
        <p>A <strong>floodplain</strong> is the flat, low-lying land on either side of a river channel that is <strong>inundated (covered) by water during a flood</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Floodplain Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Floodplains are built up over thousands of years by the <strong>vertical accretion</strong> (build-up) of fine-grained sediment (silt and clay) that is deposited as muddy floodwaters spread out and slow down.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Levees:</strong> These are low, natural ridges of coarser sediment (sand) built up right next to the river banks. When the river floods, it dumps its heaviest sediment first (right at the bank), forming these levees.</li>
            <li><strong>Backswamps:</strong> The low-lying, poorly-drained areas of the floodplain behind the natural levees. This is where the finest clay settles out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5-3">Paleo-channel</h2>
        <p>A <strong>paleo-channel</strong> (or "fossil channel") is the remnant of an old, abandoned river channel. It represents the former path of a river.</p>
        
        <h3>Identifying Paleo-channels:</h3>
        <p>These are key features to look for in the field or on satellite images/topographic maps.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Topography:</strong> They often appear as long, shallow, winding depressions in the landscape.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil/Vegetation:</strong> The sediment inside the old channel (often sand and gravel) is different from the surrounding floodplain (silt and clay). This leads to different soil and different vegetation patterns (e.g., a line of trees growing in an otherwise grassy field).</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> An ox-bow lake is a type of paleo-channel. Over time, it will fill with sediment and become an <strong>ox-bow scar</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Identifying paleo-channels is important for finding groundwater resources and understanding how a river's course has changed over time (river avulsion).</p>

        <h2 id="topic5-4">Drainage Pattern</h2>
        <p>A <strong>drainage pattern</strong> is the geometric arrangement of a river and its tributaries (the smaller streams that feed it) as seen from above. The pattern is a direct reflection of the <strong>underlying geology</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            This is a classic "skill" question. You will be shown a drainage pattern and asked to identify it and state the underlying geology.

                    <td>"Tree-like" or branching. Tributaries join at gentle (<90°) angles. The most common pattern.</td>
                    <td><strong>Homogeneous rock</strong> (rock that is uniform and has no structural control). E.g., flat-lying sedimentary rocks, massive granite.</td>

                    <td><strong>Trellis</strong></td>
                    <td>Main streams are parallel, with short tributaries joining at sharp 90° angles. Like a garden trellis.</td>
                    <td><strong>Dipping or folded sedimentary rocks</strong> of alternating hard (ridges) and soft (valleys) layers. Common in folded mountain belts.</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><strong>Radial</strong></td>
                    <td>Streams flow <strong>outward</strong> in all directions from a central high point.</td>
                    <td>A <strong>volcano</strong> or a dome-shaped mountain.</td>

                    <td>Streams follow a grid-like pattern with sharp 90° turns.</td>
                    <td><strong>Faulted or jointed rock</strong>. The water flows along the network of fractures and faults.</td>

                    <td>Streams and tributaries are parallel, flowing in the same direction.</td>
                    <td>Areas with a <strong>steep, uniform slope</strong>. Common on the sides of steep ridges.</td>
