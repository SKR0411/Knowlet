        <h2 id="topic4-1">Basics of Field Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Geological fieldwork is about making systematic observations and measurements. All data is recorded in a special <strong>field notebook</strong>, which is a permanent legal record of your observations.</p>
        
        <h3>The Field Notebook:</h3>
        <p>A field notebook must be waterproof and hard-bound. Every entry must be made in waterproof ink or pencil. The standard procedure for each "outcrop station" is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Record your precise location (using GPS coordinates or by marking on a topographic map). Give the outcrop a station number (e.g., "Stn. 1").</li>
            <li><strong>Rock Type:</strong> Describe the lithology (e.g., "Fine-grained, buff-coloured, cross-bedded sandstone").</li>
            <li><strong>Measurements (Attitude):</strong> This is the most critical data. Use a <strong>Clinometer/Brunton Compass</strong> to measure the <strong>Strike</strong> and <strong>Dip</strong> of the beds.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strike:</strong> The compass direction (azimuth) of a horizontal line on the dipping bed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dip:</strong> The maximum angle of inclination of the bed, measured perpendicular to the strike.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Structures:</strong> Note any sedimentary structures (ripples, cross-beds), faults, folds, or joints. Measure their orientations.</li>
            <li><strong>Field Sketch:</strong> Draw a sketch of the outcrop, labeling the different rock units and structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Sample:</strong> If you take a rock sample, label it with your station number (e.g., "Stn. 1").</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic4-2">Techniques of Preparing a Geological Map</h2>
        <p>Preparing a geological map is the primary objective of most fieldwork. This is done by plotting your field data onto a <strong>base map</strong> (usually a topographic map).</p>
        
        <h3>The Mapping Process:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Plot Station:</strong> Mark your location (e.g., "Stn. 1") on the base map.</li>
            <li><strong>Plot Attitude:</strong> At that point, draw the <strong>strike and dip symbol</strong> (a "T" shape, where the long bar shows the strike direction and the short "dip-tick" points in the dip direction, with the angle written next to it).</li>
            <li><strong>Plot Contacts:</strong> If you find the boundary (contact) between two rock units, draw that line on your map, tracing it as you walk along it.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcrop Completion:</strong> If outcrops are scattered, you plot all your data points (rock type, strike/dip) and then use the principles from Unit 2 (Rule of V's, outcrop completion) to draw the contact lines *between* your stations.</li>
            <li><strong>Finalizing:</strong> Once all contacts are drawn, you color the map, add a legend, and draw a cross-section to complete the interpretation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic4-3">Interaction Between Geological Structure and Topography</h2>
        <p>This concept (which includes the Rule of V's from Unit 2) is key to understanding and drawing a map. The shape of an outcrop on a map is the result of the "battle" between the <strong>geological structure</strong> (the orientation of the rock) and the <strong>topography</strong> (the shape of the land surface that cuts into it).</p>
        
        <h3>Outcrop Patterns for Folds:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Horizontal Beds:</strong> Outcrop pattern is "dendritic" (tree-like) and follows contour lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Dipping Beds:</strong> Produce "V"s in valleys.</li>
            <li><strong>Anticlines and Synclines (Non-Plunging):</strong> Show parallel bands of rock on the map, with the units repeating symmetrically on either side of the fold axis.</li>
            <li><strong>Plunging Anticlines:</strong> The rock layers close in a "U" or "V" shape on the map. The fold "plunges" (is tilted) in the direction the "V" is pointing. <strong>Oldest rocks are in the core.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Plunging Synclines:</strong> The rock layers also close in a "U" or "V" shape. The fold plunges in the direction the "V" is pointing. <strong>Youngest rocks are in the core.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Outcrop Patterns for Faults:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Faults often appear as sharp, straight lines that <strong>offset</strong> geological contacts.</li>
            <li>If a block of older rock is pushed up over younger rock, it is a <strong>thrust fault</strong>.</li>
            <li>If contacts are dropped down, it is a <strong>normal fault</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4-4">Data Analysis, Interpretation, and Report Writing</h2>
        <p>After the fieldwork is complete, the data is analyzed and compiled into a formal geological report. This is the final product of the project.</p>
        
        <h3>Analysis and Interpretation (The "Office" Work)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Finalize the Map and Cross-Section:</strong> This is the primary data analysis. The cross-section is your main interpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>Stereonet Analysis:</strong> Plot all your strike and dip measurements on a stereonet to find the average orientation of beds and the orientation of fold axes.</li>
            <li><strong>Lithologs:</strong> Compile all your measured sections (from Unit 3) to create a single, representative stratigraphic column for the entire area.</li>
            <li><strong>Geological History:</strong> Write a step-by-step summary of the area's history (e.g., "1. Deposition of Sandstone, 2. Deposition of Shale, 3. Folding into an anticline, 4. Uplift and erosion...").</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Geological Report Writing</h3>
        <p>A geological report follows a standard scientific structure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> State the <strong>aim</strong> of the project (e.g., "To map the geology of the... area") and describe the <strong>location</strong> (with a location map) and <strong>methodology</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Geology:</strong> A brief summary of the already known geology of the wider region (from published papers).</li>
            <li><strong>Stratigraphy / Lithology:</strong> Describe all the rock units you observed, from oldest to youngest (this is where you include your lithologs).</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Describe the geological structures you found (e.g., "The area is dominated by a plunging anticline..."). Include your stereonet analysis here.</li>
            <li><strong>Geological History:</strong> Your step-by-step interpretation of the area's history.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A brief summary of your main findings.</li>
            <li><strong>Appendices:</strong> Include your finalized <strong>Geological Map</strong> and <strong>Cross-Section(s)</strong>. This is the most important part!</li>
        </ol>
