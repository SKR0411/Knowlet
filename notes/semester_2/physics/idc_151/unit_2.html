        <h2 id="weather-climate">1. Weather and Climate</h2>
        <p>This is the most fundamental concept in climate science.</p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Distinction:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weather</strong> is the short-term state of the atmosphere at a specific time and place. It includes temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, etc. It's what's happening *right now* or in the near future (e.g., "It will be rainy and 25°C today").</li>
                <li><strong>Climate</strong> is the long-term statistical average of weather in a particular region. It's typically calculated over a period of 30 years or more. It describes the *expected* conditions for a time of year (e.g., "The climate in this region is tropical, with a heavy monsoon season in July").</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Climate is what you expect (your wardrobe), while weather is what you get (what you wear today).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="impacts">2. Human Impacts on Climate</h2>
        
        <h3>Biodiversity and Climate Change</h3>
        <p><strong>Biodiversity</strong> is the variety of life on Earth. Climate change threatens biodiversity by altering habitats faster than many species can adapt. As temperature and rainfall patterns shift, ecosystems (like forests and coral reefs) are put under stress, which can lead to species migration or extinction.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact of Deforestation</h3>
        <p>The cutting and clearing of forests has a two-fold climate impact:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Loss of a "Carbon Sink":</strong> Living trees absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Removing them reduces the planet's ability to soak up greenhouse gases.</li>
            <li><strong>Release of Stored Carbon:</strong> When trees are burned or left to rot, the carbon they have stored for decades is released back into the atmosphere as CO₂.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Fossil Fuel Burning and Industrialization</h3>
        <p>This is the primary driver of modern climate change.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fossil Fuels</strong> (coal, oil, and natural gas) are the remains of ancient organisms, containing vast amounts of carbon.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrialization</strong> and transportation involve burning these fuels for energy.</li>
            <li>This combustion process releases immense quantities of CO₂ into the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and causing global warming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="observation">3. Surface Weather Stations and Satellite Observation</h2>
        <p>These are the two main ways we monitor weather and climate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surface Weather Stations:</strong> These are ground-based instruments that provide highly accurate, "ground-truth" measurements of weather variables (temperature, pressure, wind, etc.) at a single point.</li>
            <li><strong>Satellite Observation:</strong> Satellites orbit the Earth and provide a global, "big picture" view. They are essential for tracking large-scale systems like hurricanes, monitoring cloud patterns, measuring sea surface temperature, and observing remote areas (like the poles or oceans) where stations are few.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="phenomena">4. Atmospheric Phenomena</h2>
        
        <h3>Cloud Seeding</h3>
        <p><strong>Cloud seeding</strong> is a form of intentional weather modification. It involves dispersing substances into the air (like silver iodide or dry ice) that act as artificial "condensation nuclei." This is done to encourage cloud droplets to form and grow, with the aim of increasing precipitation (rain or snow). Its effectiveness is still a subject of scientific debate.</p>
        
        <h3>Lightning and Discharge</h3>
        <p><strong>Lightning</strong> is a powerful, natural electrostatic discharge (a giant spark). It occurs when a large electrical charge separation builds up within a storm cloud (cumulonimbus) or between the cloud and the ground. This separation becomes so large that it overcomes the insulating properties of the air, causing a massive discharge of electricity to equalize the charge.</p>
        [Image of lightning formation in a cumulonimbus cloud]

        <h2 id="winds">5. Formation of Winds and Systems</h2>
        <p>Wind is simply air moving from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. This pressure difference is created by differential heating.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trade Winds:</strong> These are large-scale, persistent winds that blow from east to west in the tropical regions. They are a key part of the global atmospheric circulation.</li>
            [Image of global wind patterns showing trade winds]
            
            <li><strong>Local Winds:</strong> These are small-scale winds created by local geography. A common example is a <strong>sea breeze</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Day:</strong> Land heats up faster than the sea. The hot air over land rises (low pressure), and cool, dense air from the sea (high pressure) flows in to replace it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Night:</strong> Land cools faster. The sea is now warmer. Air rises over the sea (low pressure), and cool air from the land flows out (a "land breeze").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Monsoons:</strong> A massive, t<strong>seasonal reversal of wind patterns</strong>, effectively a large-scale sea breeze. In summer, the Asian continent heats up, creating a vast low-pressure area that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean, causing the heavy monsoon rains. In winter, the pattern reverses.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fogs and Clouds:</strong> Both are visible collections of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air. A <strong>cloud</strong> is formed when air rises, cools, and condensation occurs. <strong>Fog</strong> is simply a cloud that forms at or near the ground.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cyclones and Anti-cyclones:</strong> These are large-scale rotating weather systems.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cyclones (Lows):</strong> Inward-spiraling wind, rising air, clouds, and rain. (e.g., hurricanes, typhoons).</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-cyclones (Highs):</strong> Outward-spiraling wind, sinking air, and clear skies.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Thunderstorms:</strong> A smaller, more intense storm with strong updrafts, heavy rain, thunder, and lightning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="humidity">6. Droplet Growth and Humidity</h2>
        
        <h3>Droplet Growth and Condensation</h3>
        <p>For rain to form, tiny cloud droplets must grow large and heavy enough to fall.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Water vapor (a gas) must first turn into liquid droplets. This requires two conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li>The air must be cooled to its <strong>dew point</strong> (the temperature of saturation).</li>
                    <li>There must be tiny particles, called <strong>Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN)</strong> (e.g., dust, salt, pollen), for the water to condense onto.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Growth:</strong> These initial droplets are too small to fall. They grow by:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collision-Coalescence:</strong> In warm clouds, droplets collide and stick together, forming larger drops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bergeron Process:</strong> In cold clouds (containing both ice and water), water vapor preferentially deposits onto ice crystals, which grow large and fall as snow (or melt into rain).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Humidity and Humidity Parameters</h3>
        <p><strong>Humidity</strong> refers to the amount of water vapor in the air.</p>
        
        <p>Key parameters to measure it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute Humidity:</strong> The mass of water vapor in a given volume of air (e.g., grams per cubic meter).</li>
            <li><strong>Relative Humidity (RH):</strong> This is the most common measure. It's the amount of water vapor in the air, expressed as a <strong>percentage</strong> of the *maximum* amount of water vapor the air *could* hold at that specific temperature.
                <ul>
                    <li>Warm air can hold more water vapor, so 100% RH on a hot day feels much "muggier" than 100% RH (fog) on a cold day.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dew Point Temperature:</strong> The temperature to which air must be cooled (at constant pressure) to become 100% saturated. At this point, dew or fog will form. A high dew point means the air is very moist.</li>
        </ul>
