        <h2 id="pollution">1. Atmospheric Pollution </h2>
        <p><strong>Atmospheric Pollution</strong> is the introduction of harmful contaminants (pollutants) into the atmosphere at concentrations high enough to cause harm to human health, wildlife, or the environment.</p>
        
        <h3>Type of Pollutants </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Pollutants:</strong> Emitted *directly* from a source.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Carbon Monoxide (CO) from cars, Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂) from power plants, soot.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Pollutants:</strong> Not emitted directly. They are *formed in the atmosphere* through chemical reactions.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Ground-level ozone, acid rain.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Various Sources of Emissions </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stationary Sources:</strong> Power plants, factories, and industrial facilities that burn fossil fuels.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Sources:</strong> Transportation, including cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Sources:</strong> Fertilizers (releasing N₂O) and livestock (releasing CH₄).</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Sources:</strong> Volcanoes, wildfires, dust storms.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Trace Gases </h3>
        <p>These are gases present in very small amounts ("traces"). While some are harmless (like neon), others are potent pollutants and/or greenhouse gases. Examples include sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH₄), and ozone (O₃).</p>

        <h2 id="ozone">2. Stratospheric and Tropospheric Ozone </h2>
        <p>Ozone (O₃) is a single molecule, but its effect depends entirely on *where* it is in the atmosphere.</p>
        
        

        <h3>Stratospheric Ozone ("Good Ozone") </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the stratosphere (the "Ozone Layer").</li>
            <li><strong>Production:</strong> Formed naturally when high-energy UV radiation from the sun splits an O₂ molecule, and the resulting single O atoms join with other O₂ molecules (O + O₂ → O₃).</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> It is <strong>beneficial</strong>. It absorbs ~99% of the sun's harmful UV-B radiation, protecting life on Earth from skin cancer, cataracts, and DNA damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss Processes:</strong> It is naturally destroyed by reactions with other chemicals. This balance was disrupted by human-made chemicals called <strong>CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons)</strong>, which led to the "ozone hole."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tropospheric Ozone ("Bad Ozone") </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the troposphere (the layer we live in).</li>
            <li><strong>Production:</strong> It is a <strong>secondary pollutant</strong>. It is *not* emitted directly. It forms when sunlight triggers chemical reactions between:
                <ul>
                    <li>Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) - from cars and power plants.</li>
                    <li>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) - from gasoline, solvents, and industry.</li>
                </ul>
                (NOx + VOCs + Sunlight → Ground-level Ozone)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> It is <strong>harmful</strong>. It is the main component of <strong>smog</strong>, is toxic to breathe (damaging lung tissue), and is also harmful to plants and crops.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="policy">3. International Legal and Policy Framework </h2>
        <p>This refers to the global agreements and treaties designed to address climate change.</p>
        
        <h3>The Kyoto Protocol </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it was:</strong> An international treaty adopted in 1997 that extended the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</li>
            <li><strong>Main Feature:</strong> It was the first agreement to set <strong>legally binding emission reduction targets</strong> for greenhouse gases.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Issues:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>It only set binding targets for <strong>developed nations</strong>. Developing nations, including major emitters like China and India, had no binding targets.</li>
                    <li>The world's largest emitter at the time, the <strong>United States</strong>, signed the treaty but never ratified it, so it was not bound by it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Kyoto Protocol has since been superseded by the <strong>Paris Agreement (2015)</strong>, which uses a different, non-binding approach where all countries (developed and developing) set their own national targets (NDCs).</p>

        <h2 id="mitigation">4. Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation </h2>
        <p>These are the two main strategies for responding to climate change.</p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Distinction:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adaptation (Managing the Unavoidable):</strong> Actions that help us cope with the *impacts* of climate change that are already happening or are now unavoidable. It's about reducing vulnerability.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Building sea walls to protect against sea-level rise, using drought-resistant crops, improving storm warning systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation (Avoiding the Unmanageable):</strong> Actions that aim to *reduce the source* of the problem. This means reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy (solar, wind), improving energy efficiency, planting trees (reforestation), preventing deforestation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Developmental Planning </h3>
        <p>This involves incorporating both adaptation and mitigation into long-term national planning, such as in infrastructure, agriculture, and urban design, to ensure sustainable development.</p>

        <h2 id="geo-engineering">5. Geo-engineering </h2>
        <p><strong>Geo-engineering</strong> refers to the deliberate, large-scale, and highly technological intervention in the Earth's climate system to counteract global warming. These ideas are highly controversial and largely hypothetical.</p>
        
        <p>There are two main categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Solar Radiation Management (SRM):</strong> Aims to cool the planet by <strong>reflecting sunlight</strong> back to space.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to mimic a large volcanic eruption, which is known to cause global cooling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unknown side effects (e.g., on rainfall patterns), does not solve the root cause (CO₂), and would need to be done continuously.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR):</strong> Aims to <strong>remove CO₂</strong> that is already in the atmosphere.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Building large "Direct Air Capture" (DAC) machines that chemically scrub CO₂ from the air; "ocean fertilization" to promote plankton blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Extremely expensive, very slow, and has its own environmental impacts.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="panchamrit">6. Concept of Panchamrit </h2>
        <p><strong>"Panchamrit"</strong> (meaning "five nectars") is the name for <strong>India's five key climate pledges</strong> announced at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in 2021.</p>
        
        <p>India's five pledges are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To reach <strong>500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity</strong> by 2030.</li>
            <li>To get <strong>50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy</strong> by 2030.</li>
            <li>To <strong>reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes</strong> from now until 2030.</li>
            <li>To <strong>reduce the carbon intensity</strong> of its economy by 45% by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels).</li>
            <li>To achieve the target of <strong>Net Zero</strong> emissions by <strong>2070</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
