        <h2 id="atmosphere">1. Elementary Concept of Atmosphere and its Composition</h2>
        <p>The <strong>atmosphere</strong> is the vast envelope of gases surrounding the Earth, held in place by gravity. It's essential for life, protecting us from harmful radiation, regulating temperature, and providing the air we breathe.</p>
        
        <h3>Composition</h3>
        <p>The atmosphere is a mixture of gases, with dry air primarily composed of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nitrogen (N₂):</strong> ~78%</li>
            <li><strong>Oxygen (O₂):</strong> ~21%</li>
            <li><strong>Argon (Ar):</strong> ~0.93%</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):</strong> ~0.04% (highly variable and a key greenhouse gas)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other <strong>trace gases</strong> include neon, helium, methane, krypton, and hydrogen. A crucial variable component is <strong>water vapor (H₂O)</strong>, which drives weather processes.</p>

        <h2 id="dynamics">2. Introduction to Atmospheric Dynamics</h2>
        <p><strong>Atmospheric dynamics</strong> is the study of air motion. This motion (wind) is fundamentally caused by unequal heating of the Earth's surface by the sun, which creates differences in temperature and pressure.</p>
        
        <h3>Basic Conservation Laws</h3>
        <p>The complex motions of the atmosphere are governed by three fundamental principles of physics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Conservation of Mass:</strong> Air is neither created nor destroyed; it just moves and changes density. This is the basis of the continuity equation.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation of Momentum (Newton's 2nd Law, F=ma):</strong> The wind we observe is a result of a balance of forces, including the pressure gradient force (air moving from high to low pressure), the Coriolis force (due to Earth's rotation), gravity, and friction.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation of Energy (1st Law of Thermodynamics):</strong> Energy is conserved. The atmosphere gains energy from the sun and releases it back to space. This energy balance dictates the Earth's temperature and drives thermal air currents.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="variation">3. Thermal and Pressure Variation</h2>
        
        <h3>Pressure Variation</h3>
        <p>Air pressure is the weight of the column of air above a certain point. It is <strong>highest at sea level</strong> and <strong>decreases exponentially with increasing altitude</strong>. This is because there is less air pressing down from above.</p>
        
        <h3>Thermal Variation</h3>
        <p>Temperature variation with altitude is not a simple decrease. The atmosphere's temperature profile is complex, with layers of cooling and warming. This profile is used to define the layers of the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2 id="structure">4. Thermal Structure of the Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>The atmosphere is divided into four main layers based on how temperature changes with height.</p>
        
        [Image of thermal structure of the atmosphere layers]
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Troposphere (0 - ~12 km):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the lowest layer, where we live and where all <strong>weather</strong> occurs.</li>
                    <li>Temperature <strong>decreases</strong> with altitude. This is because the layer is heated from below by the Earth's surface, which absorbs sunlight.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stratosphere (~12 - 50 km):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Above the troposphere.</li>
                    <li>Temperature <strong>increases</strong> with altitude. This is known as a "temperature inversion."</li>
                    <li>This warming is caused by the <strong>Ozone Layer</strong>, which absorbs harmful high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mesosphere (~50 - 85 km):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Above the stratosphere.</li>
                    <li>Temperature <strong>decreases</strong> again with altitude, reaching the coldest temperatures in the atmosphere (around -90°C).</li>
                    <li>This is where most meteors burn up.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ionosphere (and Thermosphere):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The uppermost layer, extending for hundreds of kilometers.</li>
                    <li>Temperature <strong>increases</strong> dramatically with altitude (to over 1000°C) as high-energy solar radiation (X-rays, extreme UV) is absorbed.</li>
                    <li>The air is extremely thin here.</li>
                    <li>This layer contains electrically charged particles (ions), which are crucial for reflecting radio waves and creating auroras.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="radiation">5. Spectral Distribution of Solar Radiation</h2>
        <p>The sun emits energy across the full electromagnetic spectrum. This energy is known as solar radiation or "insolation."</p>
        
        [Image of solar radiation spectrum]
        
        <p>The spectrum can be broken down as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ultraviolet (UV):</strong> Short wavelengths, high energy. Most is absorbed by the ozone in the stratosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Visible Light:</strong> The narrow band of wavelengths our eyes can see. The atmosphere is mostly transparent to visible light, which is why it reaches the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrared (IR):</strong> Longer wavelengths, felt as heat. Some is absorbed by water vapor and CO₂ in the atmosphere, but much of it reaches the surface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Earth, being much cooler, emits radiation back to space primarily in the <strong>longwave infrared (heat)</strong> range. This outgoing heat is what greenhouse gases trap.</p>

        <h2 id="process">6. Meteorological Process and Different Systems</h2>
        <p>This refers to the formation, evolution, and movement of organized weather patterns, which are driven by atmospheric instability and pressure differences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low-Pressure System (Cyclone):</strong> A region where air pressure is lower than its surroundings. Air flows inward (converges) at the surface and then rises. This rising air cools, causing condensation, which leads to <strong>clouds and precipitation</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Pressure System (Anti-cyclone):</strong> A region where air pressure is higher than its surroundings. Air sinks from above (subsides) and flows outward (diverges) at the surface. This sinking air warms and dries, leading to <strong>clear skies and fair weather</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Fronts:</strong> Boundaries between large masses of air with different temperatures (e.g., a "cold front" is the leading edge of an advancing mass of cold air).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="observations">7. Overview of Meteorological Observations</h2>
        <p>To understand and forecast the weather, we must constantly measure the state of the atmosphere. This is done in two main ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surface Observations:</strong> Using ground-based <strong>weather stations</strong> to measure conditions at the surface, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed/direction, and precipitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Upper-Air Observations:</strong> Using <strong>radiosondes</strong> (instrument packages on weather balloons) and <strong>satellites</strong> to measure conditions at various altitudes in the atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>
