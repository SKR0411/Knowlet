        <h2 id="newton-law">1. Newton's Law of Gravitation </h2>
        <p>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force (<strong>F</strong>) that is directly proportional to the product of their masses (m₁ and m₂) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centers.</p>
        
        <blockquote><strong>Formula (Magnitude):</strong> F = G * (m₁m₂) / r²</blockquote>
        
        <p>Where <strong>G</strong> is the universal gravitational constant (G ≈ 6.674 × 10<sup>-11</sup> N·m²/kg²).</p>
        
        <p>In vector form, the force <strong>F</strong>₁₂ (force on m₁ due to m₂) is:</p>
        <blockquote><strong>Formula (Vector):</strong> <strong>F</strong>₁₂ = -G * (m₁m₂) / r² * <strong>r̂</strong>₁₂</blockquote>
        <p>Where <strong>r̂</strong>₁₂ is the unit vector pointing from m₁ to m₂. The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.</p>

        <h2 id="central-force">2. Motion in a Central Force Field </h2>
        <p>A <strong>central force</strong> is a force <strong>F</strong>(<strong>r</strong>) that is always directed along the line connecting the particle to a fixed center (the origin) and whose magnitude depends only on the distance |<strong>r</strong>| from the center.</p>
        <blockquote><strong>Formula:</strong> <strong>F</strong>(<strong>r</strong>) = f(r) <strong>r̂</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Gravitation is a perfect example of a central force, where f(r) = -G(Mm)/r².</p>
        
        <h3>Properties of Central Force Motion:</h3>
        
        <h4>a) Motion is in a Plane </h4>
        <p>The torque (<strong>τ</strong>) on the particle (mass m) about the force center is:</p>
        <p><strong>τ</strong> = <strong>r</strong> × <strong>F</strong> = <strong>r</strong> × (f(r) <strong>r̂</strong>)</p>
        <p>Since <strong>r</strong> and <strong>r̂</strong> are parallel, <strong>r</strong> × <strong>r̂</strong> = <strong>0</strong>. Therefore, the <strong>net torque is zero</strong>.</p>
        <p>From Newton's second law for rotation, <strong>τ</strong> = d<strong>L</strong>/dt, where <strong>L</strong> is the angular momentum.
        <br>If <strong>τ</strong> = <strong>0</strong>, then d<strong>L</strong>/dt = <strong>0</strong>, which means <strong>L</strong> is constant.</p>
        <p><strong>L</strong> = <strong>r</strong> × <strong>p</strong> = constant. By definition, the vector <strong>L</strong> is perpendicular to both <strong>r</strong> and <strong>p</strong> (velocity <strong>v</strong>). Since <strong>L</strong> is a constant vector (it doesn't change direction), the position <strong>r</strong> and velocity <strong>v</strong> must *always* remain in the plane that is perpendicular to <strong>L</strong>.
        <br><strong>Conclusion:</strong> All central force motion is confined to a plane.</p>

        <h4>b) Angular Momentum is Conserved </h4>
        <p>As shown above, the torque <strong>τ</strong> is always zero for a central force. This directly implies that the <strong>total angular momentum L of the particle is conserved</strong> (it is constant in both magnitude and direction).</p>
        
        <h4>c) Areal Velocity is Constant </h4>
        <p><strong>Areal velocity (dA/dt)</strong> is the rate at which the position vector <strong>r</strong> "sweeps out" an area as the particle moves.</p>
        <p>In a small time dt, the particle moves by d<strong>r</strong> = <strong>v</strong> dt. The small area (dA) of the triangle swept out is:</p>
        <p>dA = (1/2) |<strong>r</strong> × d<strong>r</strong>| = (1/2) |<strong>r</strong> × <strong>v</strong> dt|</p>
        <p>So, the areal velocity is:</p>
        <p>dA/dt = (1/2) |<strong>r</strong> × <strong>v</strong>| = (1/2) |<strong>r</strong> × (<strong>p</strong>/m)| = (1/2m) |<strong>r</strong> × <strong>p</strong>|</p>
        <p>Since <strong>L</strong> = <strong>r</strong> × <strong>p</strong>, we get:</p>
        <blockquote><strong>Formula:</strong> dA/dt = L / (2m)</blockquote>
        <p>Because angular momentum (L) and mass (m) are both constant in central force motion, the <strong>areal velocity (dA/dt) is also constant</strong>. This is the content of Kepler's Second Law.</p>

        <h2 id="kepler-laws">3. Kepler's Laws </h2>
        <p>Kepler's three laws describe the motion of planets around the Sun.</p>
        
        <h3>Law 1: The Law of Orbits</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Statement:</strong> All planets move in <strong>elliptical orbits</strong> with the Sun at one of the two foci.</blockquote>
        <p>A circle is just a special case of an ellipse where the two foci coincide. The shape of the orbit (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) is determined by the total energy of the planet.</p>
        
        <h3>Law 2: The Law of Areas</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Statement:</strong> A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out <strong>equal areas in equal intervals of time</strong>.</blockquote>
        <p>This is a direct consequence of the <strong>conservation of angular momentum</strong> (areal velocity is constant), as proved in the section above. This means the planet moves *faster* when it is closer to the Sun (at perihelion) and *slower* when it is farther away (at aphelion).</p>
        <h3>Law 3: The Law of Periods</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Statement:</strong> The square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>Formula:</strong> T² ∝ a³  or  T²/a³ = constant</blockquote>
        <p>For a simple circular orbit of radius 'r' (where a = r) around a large mass M, we can derive this:</p>
        <p>Gravitational Force = Centripetal Force
        <br>G(Mm) / r² = m(v²) / r
        <br>G M / r = v²
        <br>Since v = (circumference) / (period) = (2πr) / T, we have v² = 4π²r² / T²
        <br>G M / r = 4π²r² / T²
        <br>Rearranging for T²: <strong>T² = (4π² / GM) r³</strong>
        <br>This shows T² ∝ r³, and the constant of proportionality is 4π²/GM.</p>
        
        <h2 id="satellites">4. Satellites </h2>
        
        <h3>Satellite in Circular Orbit </h3>
        <p>For a satellite of mass 'm' in a circular orbit of radius 'r' (from Earth's center) around Earth (mass M):</p>
        
        <h4>Orbital Velocity (v<sub>o</sub>)</h4>
        <p>As derived above (G M / r = v²):</p>
        <blockquote><strong>Formula:</strong> v<sub>o</sub> = √(GM / r)</blockquote>
        <p>Note that orbital velocity *decreases* as the orbital radius 'r' *increases*.</p>
        
        <h3>Geosynchronous Orbits </h3>
        <p>A <strong>geosynchronous</strong> orbit is any orbit around the Earth with an orbital period (T) of <strong>exactly 24 hours</strong> (one sidereal day, to be precise: ~23h 56m).</p>
        <p>This means the satellite returns to the exact same point in the sky at the same time each day.</p>
        
        <h3>Geostationary Satellites </h3>
        <p>A <strong>geostationary</strong> orbit is a *special type* of geosynchronous orbit.</p>
        <p><strong>Conditions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> T = 24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Orbital Plane:</strong> Must be in the <strong>equatorial plane</strong> (0° inclination).</li>
            <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Must orbit in the same direction as Earth's rotation (west to east).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> A satellite in this orbit appears to be <strong>fixed</strong> at a single point in the sky. All three conditions must be met.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong>  This is extremely useful for <strong>communications satellites</strong> and weather satellites. You can point a stationary satellite dish on Earth at the satellite, and it will never move.</p>
        
        <h2 id="weightlessness">5. Weightlessness </h2>
        <p><strong>Weight</strong> is the force you feel (e.g., the normal force from the floor pushing up on you). "Weightlessness" is the sensation of having no weight. It is not the absence of gravity!</p>
        <p>True weightlessness occurs during <strong>free-fall</strong>. An astronaut in a satellite orbiting the Earth is in a constant state of free-fall. The satellite (and everything in it) is "falling" around the Earth. The gravitational force (F<sub>g</sub>) is providing the *exact* centripetal force (F<sub>c</sub>) needed to stay in orbit.</p>
        <p>Since the astronaut and the satellite are "falling" together, the astronaut does not press against the floor. The normal force is zero, and they feel "weightless."</p>
        
        <h2 id="gps">6. Global Positioning System (GPS) </h2>
        <p>The <strong>Global Positioning System (GPS)</strong> is a satellite-based navigation system.</p>
        <p><strong>Basic Idea:</strong>  It consists of a constellation of ~30 satellites orbiting the Earth. Each satellite continuously broadcasts a signal containing its precise location and the precise time (from an onboard atomic clock).</p>
        <p>A GPS receiver on Earth (like in your phone) receives these signals.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The receiver gets signals from multiple satellites (at least 4).</li>
            <li>By measuring the *time delay* for each signal to arrive, it can calculate its distance to each of those satellites (distance = speed of light × time).</li>
            <li>Using a process called <strong>trilateration</strong>, the receiver can pinpoint its own 3D location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) on Earth.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> GPS satellites are *not* in geostationary orbit. They are in a medium-Earth orbit (MEO) at about 20,200 km altitude, with a period of ~12 hours. This ensures they move across the sky, allowing a receiver to see different satellites over time. The system's accuracy famously depends on correcting for both Special and General Relativity.
