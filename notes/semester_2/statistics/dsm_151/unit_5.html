        <p>This unit builds on the axioms from Unit 4 to derive the fundamental rules for calculating complex probabilities.</p>

        <h2 id="conditional">5.1 Conditional Probability </h2>
        
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The <strong>conditional probability</strong> of event A occurring, <strong>given that</strong> event B has already occurred, is denoted P(A | B).</p>
        <p>It "restricts" the sample space. We are now only interested in the outcomes where B happened. Out of those, what is the probability that A *also* happened?</p>
        
        
        <div class="formula">P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B),   provided P(B) > 0</div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Rolling a fair die. S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
                <ul>
                    <li>Let A = "Get a number > 3" = {4, 5, 6}. P(A) = 3/6.</li>
                    <li>Let B = "Get an even number" = {2, 4, 6}. P(B) = 3/6.</li>
                    <li>A ∩ B = {4, 6}. P(A ∩ B) = 2/6.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Question:</strong> What is the probability of getting a number > 3, GIVEN that it was an even number? (Find P(A | B)).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Method 1 (Formula):</strong> P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = (2/6) / (3/6) = 2/3.</li>
                    <li><strong>Method 2 (Logic):</strong> We know the outcome is B = {2, 4, 6}. This is our new sample space (size 3). Within this set, which outcomes are also in A? {4, 6} (size 2). Therefore, the probability is 2/3.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="multiplication">5.2 Multiplication Theorem of Probability </h2>
        <p>This is just a rearrangement of the conditional probability formula. It's used to find the probability of an <strong>intersection</strong> (A AND B).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>General Rule:</strong>
            <div class="formula">P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B | A)</div>
            <p>...or...</p>
            <div class="formula">P(A ∩ B) = P(B) * P(A | B)</div>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>In words:</strong> "The probability of A and B both happening is the probability of A happening, *times* the probability of B happening *given that A has already happened*."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Draw 2 cards from a deck *without replacement*. What is P(King and then Queen)?
                <ul>
                    <li>A = 1st card is King. P(A) = 4/52.</li>
                    <li>B = 2nd card is Queen.</li>
                    <li>We need P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B | A).</li>
                    <li>P(B | A) = "Prob. of 2nd being Queen, GIVEN 1st was a King." After taking one King, there are 51 cards left, 4 of which are Queens. So, P(B | A) = 4/51.</li>
                    <li>P(A ∩ B) = (4/52) * (4/51) = 16/2652.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="addition">5.3 Addition Theorem of Probability </h2>
        <p>This rule is used to find the probability of a <strong>union</strong> (A OR B).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>General Rule (for ANY two events):</strong>
            <div class="formula">P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</div>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>In words:</strong> "We add P(A) and P(B). But if we do, we've double-counted the intersection (A ∩ B), so we must subtract it once."</p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Special Case (Mutually Exclusive Events):</strong>
            <p>If A and B are mutually exclusive, then A ∩ B = Ø, so P(A ∩ B) = 0.</p>
            <p>The formula simplifies to: <strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</strong>. (This is Axiom 3 from Unit 4).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="total_prob">5.4 Theorem of Total Probability </h2>
        <p>This theorem is used to find the "total" probability of an event (A) when we don't know P(A) directly, but we *do* know its conditional probability based on a set of other events.</p>
        
        <p>Let B₁, B₂, ..., Bₙ be a set of events that are <strong>mutually exclusive and exhaustive</strong> (they form a "partition" of the entire sample space S).</p>
        
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Theorem:</strong>
            <div class="formula">P(A) = P(A | B₁)P(B₁) + P(A | B₂)P(B₂) + ... + P(A | Bₙ)P(Bₙ)</div>
            <p>...which can be written using the multiplication rule as...</p>
            <div class="formula">P(A) = P(A ∩ B₁) + P(A ∩ B₂) + ... + P(A ∩ Bₙ)</div>
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urn 1 (B₁) has 2 Red, 3 White balls. P(B₁) = 1/2.</li>
                    <li>Urn 2 (B₂) has 4 Red, 1 White ball. P(B₂) = 1/2.</li>
                    <li>You pick an urn at random and then pick one ball. What is the total probability of getting a Red ball (A)?</li>
                    <li>P(A | B₁) = Prob. Red GIVEN Urn 1 = 2/5.</li>
                    <li>P(A | B₂) = Prob. Red GIVEN Urn 2 = 4/5.</li>
                    <li>P(A) = P(A | B₁)P(B₁) + P(A | B₂)P(B₂)</li>
                    <li>P(A) = (2/5)(1/2) + (4/5)(1/2) = 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="independence">5.5 Independent Events </h2>
        
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Two events A and B are <strong>statistically independent</strong> if the occurrence of one event <strong>does not affect</strong> the probability of the other event occurring.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Formal Definition:</strong> A and B are independent if and only if:
            <div class="formula">P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)</div>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This leads to the <strong>Multiplication Rule for Independent Events</strong>:</p>
        <p>If A and B are independent, P(A | B) = P(A) and P(B | A) = P(B).</p>
        
        <div class="common-mistake">
            <strong>Independent vs. Mutually Exclusive</strong> - This is a very common point of confusion.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mutually Exclusive:</strong> P(A ∩ B) = 0. (If A happens, B *cannot* happen). They are highly <strong>dependent</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent:</strong> P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). (If A happens, it doesn't change B's probability). They *can* happen together (unless P(A) or P(B) is 0).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Pairwise vs. Mutual Independence </h3>
        <p>For <strong>three</strong> events (A, B, C):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pairwise Independent:</strong> They are independent in pairs.
                <ul>
                    <li>P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)</li>
                    <li>P(A ∩ C) = P(A)P(C)</li>
                    <li>P(B ∩ C) = P(B)P(C)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mutually Independent:</strong> They are pairwise independent, AND...
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A)P(B)P(C)</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip"><strong>Mutual independence is a stronger condition than pairwise independence.</strong> You can have events that are pairwise independent but not mutually independent.</div>

        <h2 id="bayes">5.6 Bayes' Theorem and Applications </h2>
        <p>Bayes' Theorem is one of the most important theorems in probability. It is used to <strong>update a probability</strong> based on <strong>new evidence</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>It "flips" a conditional probability. We often know P(Evidence | Hypothesis), but we *want* to know P(Hypothesis | Evidence).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We know P(Symptom | Disease).</li>
            <li>We want to know P(Disease | Symptom).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Theorem</h3>
        <p>Let B₁, B₂, ..., Bₙ be a partition of the sample space (e.g., "Disease 1", "Disease 2", "No Disease"). Let A be some new evidence (e.g., "Positive Test Result").</p>
        
        <p>Bayes' Theorem finds the probability of a specific hypothesis (say, Bₖ) given the evidence (A):</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <div class="formula">P(Bₖ | A) = [ P(A | Bₖ) * P(Bₖ) ] / P(A)</div>
            <p>Using the Theorem of Total Probability for P(A), this is written as:</p>
            <div class="formula">P(Bₖ | A) = [ P(A | Bₖ)P(Bₖ) ] / [ Σ P(A | Bᵢ)P(Bᵢ) ]</div>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>P(Bₖ): Prior Probability.</strong> Our belief in the hypothesis *before* seeing the new evidence. (e.g., the general prevalence of the disease in a population).</li>
            <li><strong>P(A | Bₖ): Likelihood.</strong> The probability of seeing the evidence, *given* that our hypothesis is true. (e.g., the "true positive rate" or "sensitivity" of the test).</li>
            <li><strong>P(A): Marginal Likelihood / Total Probability.</strong> The total probability of seeing the evidence, averaged over all possible hypotheses.</li>
            <li><strong>P(Bₖ | A): Posterior Probability.</strong> Our *updated* belief in the hypothesis *after* seeing the evidence. This is the answer we are looking for.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="formula">Posterior = (Likelihood * Prior) / Evidence</div>
        
        <h3>Example </h3>
        <p>A factory has two machines. Machine 1 (B₁) makes 60% of products (P(B₁)=0.6). Machine 2 (B₂) makes 40% (P(B₂)=0.4).
        <br>Machine 1 has a 5% defect rate (P(A|B₁)=0.05).
        <br>Machine 2 has a 10% defect rate (P(A|B₂)=0.10).
        <br><strong>Question:</strong> You find a defective product (A). What is the probability it came from Machine 1? (Find P(B₁ | A)).</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Find P(A) (Total Probability of a Defect):</strong>
                <br>P(A) = P(A|B₁)P(B₁) + P(A|B₂)P(B₂)
                <br>P(A) = (0.05)(0.60) + (0.10)(0.40)
                <br>P(A) = 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.07 (7% of all products are defective)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use Bayes' Formula:</strong>
                <br>P(B₁ | A) = [ P(A | B₁)P(B₁) ] / P(A)
                <br>P(B₁ | A) = (0.05 * 0.60) / 0.07
                <br>P(B₁ | A) = 0.03 / 0.07 = 3/7 ≈ 0.428
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Even though Machine 1 makes more products, a defective item is more likely to be from Machine 2 (P(B₂|A) = 4/7). Our prior belief (60%) that it was from Machine 1 has been updated *downward* (to 42.8%) based on the new evidence that the product was defective.</p>
