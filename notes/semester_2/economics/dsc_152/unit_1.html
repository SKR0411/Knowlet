                <h2>1. Major features of the economy since independence </h2>
                <p>When India gained independence in 1947, it inherited an economy shattered by colonial exploitation. The post-independence development journey has been transformative, though marked by significant challenges.</p>
                
                <h3>Features at Independence (1947):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stagnant and Agrarian Economy:</strong> The economy was overwhelmingly rural, with over 75% of the population dependent on agriculture. Growth was extremely low (less than 1% per year) and per capita income was stagnant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Productivity:</strong> Agriculture was characterized by subsistence farming, fragmented land holdings, and reliance on monsoons. Productivity (output per hectare) was among the lowest in the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>De-industrialization:</strong> The British systematically dismantled India's world-famous handicraft and textile industries to create a market for their own manufactured goods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Infrastructure:</strong> While railways and ports were built, their primary purpose was to transport raw materials out of India and move troops, not to foster internal economic integration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rampant Poverty and Inequality:</strong> A vast majority of the population lived in extreme poverty, while a small class of landlords (Zamindars) and princes controlled most of the wealth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Major Features of Development Since Independence:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planned Economy Model (1950-1991):</strong> India adopted a **mixed economy** framework, relying on Five-Year Plans. This model prioritized the **public sector** ("commanding heights") for developing heavy industry and infrastructure (e.g., steel plants, dams).</li>
                    <li><strong>Import-Substituting Industrialization (ISI):</strong> The strategy was to produce goods domestically (like cars, machinery) rather than importing them. This was enforced through high tariffs and strict import licensing ("License-Permit Raj").</li>
                    <li><strong>Shift to a Market Economy (1991-Present):</strong> Following a severe economic crisis in 1991, India launched the **New Economic Policy (NEP)**. This was based on **Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG)**, dismantling the "License Raj" and opening the economy to foreign trade and investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Transformation:</strong> The contribution of agriculture to GDP has fallen from over 50% to around 15%, while the **services sector** (IT, banking, transport) has boomed to become the largest contributor (over 55% of GDP).</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="common-mistake">
                    <strong>Structural Transformation vs. Employment:</strong>
                    <p>A common mistake is to assume employment has shifted just like GDP. While the *services* sector leads GDP, the *agriculture* sector still employs the largest share of the population (around 45-50%). This mismatch is a core problem, indicating low productivity and disguised unemployment in agriculture.</p>

                <h2>2. Demographic trends and issues </h2>
                <p>Demography is the study of population trends. India's demographic journey is central to its economic story.</p>

                <h3>Key Demographic Trends:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Theory of Demographic Transition:</strong> India is in the middle of this transition.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stage 1 (Pre-1921):</strong> High Birth Rate (HBR) and High Death Rate (HDR). Population growth was low and unstable. 1921 is called the <strong>"Year of Great Divide"</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage 2 (1921-1971):</strong> HDR fell sharply due to better public health (control of cholera, smallpox) and food security. HBR remained high. This led to a **"population explosion"**.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage 3 (1971-Present):</strong> HBR has started to fall due to rising education, urbanization, and family planning. Population growth is slowing but still positive.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>High Population Growth:</strong> India's population grew from ~361 million in 1951 to ~1.21 billion in 2011 (and is now the world's largest).</li>
                    <li><strong>Falling Fertility Rate:</strong> The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has now fallen to 2.0, which is *below* the replacement level (2.1). This indicates the population will eventually stabilize.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rising Life Expectancy:</strong> Life expectancy at birth has risen dramatically from ~32 years in 1947 to around 70 years today.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Demographic Issues:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Demographic Dividend:</strong> This is the *economic opportunity* created by having a larger share of the population in the working-age group (15-59) compared to the non-working (dependent) group (0-14 and 60+).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Challenge ("Demographic Burden"):</strong> This "dividend" is not automatic. If the large working-age population is not educated, healthy, and cannot find productive jobs, it becomes a "demographic burden" or "disaster," leading to high unemployment and social unrest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adverse Sex Ratio:</strong> A persistent social issue, with the number of females per 1000 males being unnaturally low in many states due to son preference and female foeticide.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Education </h2>
                <p>Education is a key component of human capital, essential for long-term economic development.</p>

                <h3>Status and Progress:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Literacy Rate:</strong> Has improved significantly from a mere 16% in 1951 to 74.04% in 2011.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enrollment:</strong> Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER) have improved at all levels (primary, secondary, higher education).</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender Parity:</strong> Gaps between male and female literacy and enrollment have narrowed considerably, though they still exist.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Persistent Challenges:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poor Quality:</strong> The biggest challenge is not enrollment but *learning outcomes*. Reports (like the ASER report) consistently show that many children in primary school cannot do basic reading or arithmetic.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Dropout Rates:</strong> Many students, especially from poor backgrounds and female students, drop out before completing their schooling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure Gaps:</strong> Lack of trained teachers, poor teacher-pupil ratios, and inadequate facilities (toilets, electricity) remain problems, especially in rural areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill Mismatch:</strong> Higher education often produces graduates who lack the skills required by the modern job market, leading to "educated unemployment."</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="policy-focus">
                    <strong>Major Education Policies:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009:</strong> Made free and compulsory education a fundamental right for all children aged 6 to 14.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA):</strong> A flagship program for universalizing elementary education.</li>
                        <li><strong>National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:</strong> The latest policy framework aiming for major structural reforms in both school and higher education.</li>

                <h2>4. Health </h2>
                <p>Health is the other pillar of human capital. A healthy workforce is a productive workforce.</p>

                <h3>Status and Progress:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eradication of Diseases:</strong> Major successes in eradicating smallpox and largely controlling diseases like polio, malaria, and tuberculosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Health Indicators:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Increased from ~32 to ~70 years.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):</strong> Drastically reduced from over 145 per 1000 live births in 1951 to around 27 in 2023.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR):</strong> Also significantly reduced.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Persistent Challenges:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low Public Spending:</strong> India's public expenditure on health (as a % of GDP) has been one of the lowest in the world, leading to a weak public health system.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE):</strong> Because the public system is weak, most people are forced to use expensive private hospitals, paying from their own savings. A single health emergency can push a family into poverty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rural-Urban Divide:</strong> A severe "urban bias" exists, with most doctors, specialists, and quality hospitals concentrated in cities, leaving rural areas underserved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicable vs. Non-Communicable Diseases:</strong> India faces a "dual disease burden." It still battles communicable diseases (like TB) while also seeing a massive rise in non-communicable or "lifestyle" diseases (like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer).</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="policy-focus">
                    <strong>Major Health Policies:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>National Health Mission (NHM):</strong> (Originally NRHM) Aims to strengthen the public health system, especially in rural areas, by funding Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ayushman Bharat (2018):</strong> A two-pronged scheme:
                            1.  **Health and Wellness Centres:** Upgrading PHCs.
                            2.  **PM-JAY:** A health insurance scheme providing a 5-lakh rupee cover per family per year for secondary and tertiary care.

                <h2>5. Malnutrition </h2>
                <p>Malnutrition is a critical issue that directly links poverty, health, and education. It's not just a lack of food (under-nutrition) but also a lack of the *right* food (micronutrient deficiency).</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person's intake of energy and/or nutrients.
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Key Indicators and Challenges:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stunting:</strong> Low height for age. This indicates chronic (long-term) malnutrition and has irreversible effects on cognitive development (brain function). India has one of the highest rates of stunting in the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wasting:</strong> Low weight for height. This indicates acute (short-term) severe malnutrition, often caused by recent illness or food shortage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> Low weight for age (a combination of stunting and wasting).</li>
                    <li><strong>Anemia:</strong> A widespread micronutrient deficiency (iron) that affects a majority of adolescent girls and pregnant women, leading to low productivity and risks during childbirth.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="common-mistake">
                    <strong>Food Security vs. Nutrition Security:</strong>
                    <p>India has achieved <strong>food security</strong> (we produce enough calories to feed everyone, thanks to the Green Revolution). However, we have failed to achieve <strong>nutrition security</strong>. A diet heavy in rice or wheat can fill the stomach but may lack essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals, leading to malnutrition.</p>

                <div class="policy-focus">
                    <strong>Policies to Tackle Malnutrition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS):</strong> A flagship program run through "Anganwadi" centres. It provides supplementary nutrition, health check-ups, and pre-school education to children under 6 and to pregnant/lactating mothers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS):</strong> (Now PM-POSHAN) Provides a hot cooked meal to all government school children to improve nutrition and school attendance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Distribution System (PDS):</strong> (Now under the National Food Security Act, 2013) Provides subsidized food grains (rice, wheat) to poor households.</li>
