                <h2>1. Labour force growth </h2>
                
                <h3>Key Definitions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Working-Age Population:</strong> The total number of people in the age group of 15-59 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Labour Force:</strong> The number of people who are either <strong>employed</strong> OR <strong>unemployed</strong> (i.e., actively seeking a job).</li>
                    <li><strong>Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR):</strong>
                        <blockquote>
                        LFPR = (Total Labour Force / Total Working-Age Population) * 100
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Trends and Issues in Labour Force Growth:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Demographic Dividend":</strong> India's labour force is growing rapidly as a large cohort of young people enters the working-age group. This is the "dividend" or opportunity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Female LFPR:</strong> A major and persistent challenge. India has one of the lowest female LFPRs in the world. Many educated women drop out of the labour force after marriage or childbirth, representing a huge loss of economic potential.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Informal Sector:</strong> Over 90% of India's labour force works in the **informal (or unorganized) sector**. This means they have no job security, no social benefits (like pensions or health insurance), and are not protected by labour laws.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section id="occupational-structure">
                <h2>2. Occupational structure and economic development </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Occupational structure refers to the distribution of the labour force across the three main sectors of the economy.
                </blockquote>
                
                <h3>The Three Sectors:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Primary Sector:</strong> Agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Sector:</strong> Manufacturing, construction, utilities (electricity, gas, water).</li>
                    <li><strong>Tertiary Sector:</strong> Services (trade, transport, banking, IT, health, education, tourism).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Occupational Structure and Economic Development:</h3>
                <p>Economic development (as seen in developed countries) involves a structural transformation where labour moves from low-productivity to high-productivity sectors.</p>
                <p><strong>The "Standard" Path:</strong> <strong>Primary Sector → Secondary Sector → Tertiary Sector</strong></p>
                <p>Countries first industrialize (manufacturing) and then move to a service-based economy. This process pulls surplus labour out of agriculture, raises overall productivity, and increases incomes.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> India has "jumped" from an agricultural economy to a service economy, bypassing the crucial job-creating industrialization phase. This has led to the persistent problem of unemployment and under-employment.</p>

                <h2>4. Nature and pattern of unemployment in India </h2>
                <p>Unemployment in India is not just one problem; it takes several different forms, especially in rural vs. urban areas.</p>

                <h3>Types of Unemployment in India (Exam-Focus):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disguised Unemployment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Where:</strong> Primarily in the agricultural sector.</li>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> A situation where more people are employed in a job than are actually needed. For example, if 4 people are working on a small farm where 2 could do the job, then 2 people are in disguised unemployment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Their <strong>Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) is zero</strong>. Removing them would not reduce the total output.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal Unemployment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Where:</strong> Primarily in agriculture.</li>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> People find work only during certain seasons of the year (e.g., during sowing and harvesting) and are unemployed for the rest of the year.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Unemployment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Where:</strong> Across the whole economy.</li>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> A mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills demanded by employers. (e.g., a high demand for IT professionals but a surplus of low-skilled laborers).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Educated Unemployment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Where:</strong> Primarily in urban areas.</li>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> A specific type of structural unemployment where individuals with degrees (graduates, post-graduates) are unable to find jobs that match their qualifications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h2>5. Policies to tackle unemployment problem </h2>
                <p>The government's approach can be broadly divided into three categories:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Wage Employment Programmes:</strong>
                        <p>These are programmes that directly provide jobs, typically on public works projects.</p>
                        <div class="policy-focus">
                            <strong>MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) 2005:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This is the most important example. It is not just a scheme but an *Act of Parliament*.</li>
                                <li>It is a **rights-based** policy that <strong>guarantees 100 days</strong> of unskilled manual wage employment in a financial year to every rural household that demands it.</li>
                                <li>It acts as a "social safety net" and "employer of last resort."</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Employment Programmes:</strong>
                        <p>These policies aim to help people start their own businesses by providing subsidized credit and training.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> MUDRA Yojana (providing loans to non-corporate, small micro-enterprises).</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Skill Development Programmes:</strong>
                        <p>These policies aim to tackle *structural* unemployment by training the workforce.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Skill India Mission and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) aim to provide industry-relevant skill training to a large number of youth.</li>

                <h2>6. Indian Trade Union movement- A Brief Overview </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> A trade union is an organized association of workers in a trade or profession, formed to protect and further their rights and interests (e.g., higher wages, better working conditions, job security).
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Key Features of the Indian Trade Union Movement:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Political Affiliation:</strong> This is the most defining feature. Almost every major trade union in India is affiliated with a national political party.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> BMS (affiliated with BJP), INTUC (Congress), AITUC (CPI), CITU (CPI-M).</li>
                            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> This often means that union priorities are influenced by political rivalries rather than pure worker interests.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Multiplicity of Unions:</strong> Because of political linkages, a single factory (e.g., a steel plant) may have multiple, competing unions, each affiliated with a different party. This weakens their collective bargaining power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Organized Sector:</strong> Trade unions are almost exclusively present in the **organized (formal) sector** (e.g., public sector banks, railways, large factories).</li>
                    <li><strong>Neglect of Unorganized Sector:</strong> The vast majority of Indian workers (90%+) in the informal sector (e.g., farm laborers, street vendors, construction workers) have no union representation and no legal protections.</li>
