                <h2>1. Production, productivity and cropping patterns </h2>
                
                <h3>Production vs. Productivity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Production:</strong> This refers to the <strong>total output</strong> of a crop (e.g., 100 million tonnes of wheat). India's total food grain production has increased magnificently, from ~51 million tonnes in 1950-51 to over 300 million tonnes today.</li>
                    <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> This refers to the <strong>output per unit of input</strong> (e.g., tonnes of wheat *per hectare*). This was the main problem at independence. While production has risen, India's *productivity* for most crops (except wheat) still lags behind global averages.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Cropping Patterns</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> A cropping pattern is the proportion of total cultivated land that is occupied by different crops at a particular time.
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>At Independence:</strong> The pattern was dominated by <strong>food crops</strong> (cereals like rice, wheat, millets) over <strong>cash crops</strong> (like cotton, sugarcane, jute). This was a feature of a subsistence economy.</li>
                    <li><strong>After Green Revolution:</strong> The pattern shifted heavily *towards* rice and wheat, as these were the crops that benefited from HYV seeds and price support (MSP). This came at the expense of more nutritious crops like pulses and millets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Agricultural credit & marketing </h2>
                <p>These are two of the most significant challenges for farmers.</p>

                <h3>Agricultural Credit</h3>
                <p>Farmers need credit (loans) for two main reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Short-Term (Crop Loans):</strong> To buy seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-Term:</strong> To buy machinery (tractors), dig wells, or purchase land.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The main issue has been the *source* of credit:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Non-Institutional Sources</th>
                            <th>Institutional Sources</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Local moneylenders, traders, landlords.</td>
                            <td>Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Cooperatives.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Problem:</strong> Extremely high interest rates, leading to farmer <strong>debt traps</strong>.</td>
                            <td><strong>Goal:</strong> Provide cheaper, regulated credit.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <div class="policy-focus">
                    <strong>Major Steps in Institutional Credit:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Nationalization of Banks (1969):</strong> Forced commercial banks to open rural branches and lend to "priority sectors" like agriculture.</li>
                        <li><strong>NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) (1982):</strong> The apex institution that refinances and regulates all rural credit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme (1998):</strong> A popular scheme to provide simple and flexible credit to farmers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Agricultural Marketing</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Involves all activities from the farm to the consumer, including harvesting, grading, storing, transporting, and selling the produce.
                </blockquote>
                
                <p><strong>Traditional Problems:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distress Sale:</strong> Farmers are forced to sell their crop immediately after harvest (when prices are lowest) because they have no storage and need immediate cash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Role of Middlemen (Arhatiyas):</strong> A long chain of middlemen between the farmer and the final consumer, with each taking a cut, reducing the farmer's share of the final price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Storage:</strong> Inadequate warehousing (especially cold storage) leads to massive post-harvest losses, particularly for fruits and vegetables.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="policy-focus">
                    <strong>Government Intervention in Marketing:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Regulated Markets (Mandis):</strong> Set up under state <strong>APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) Acts</strong> to create transparent auction platforms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum Support Price (MSP):</strong> A price *floor* set by the government. If the market price falls below MSP, the government (via <strong>FCI - Food Corporation of India</strong>) steps in and buys the crop at the MSP, insuring the farmer against a price crash.</li>
                    </ul>

            <section id="land-reforms">
                <h2>3. Land reforms </h2>
                <p>Immediately after independence, "land to the tiller" was a major slogan. Land reforms aimed to break the exploitative colonial agrarian structure and ensure social justice.</p>

                <h3>Main Components of Land Reforms:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Abolition of Intermediaries:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> This meant abolishing the <strong>Zamindari system</strong>. Zamindars were non-cultivating landlords who collected rent for the British.</li>
                            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mostly successful. It brought ~20 million tenant farmers into a direct relationship with the state.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tenancy Reforms:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> Aimed to protect *tenants* (who cultivated land they didn't own). It had three parts: (1) Regulation of rent, (2) Security of tenure, and (3) Conferring ownership rights to tenants.</li>
                            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Moderately successful. It was often evaded by landlords who "resumed" cultivation themselves (often by evicting tenants).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Land Ceilings:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> This policy set a maximum limit ("ceiling") on the amount of land one family could own. Any surplus land was to be taken by the government and redistributed to landless laborers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Largely a failure. Landlords used loopholes, "benami" (fake) transfers, and legal challenges to hold onto their land. Very little surplus land was actually redistributed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Consolidation of Holdings:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> Aimed to solve the problem of *fragmentation* (where a farmer owns many small plots scattered in different places). This policy consolidated these plots into one single, viable farm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Successful, especially in Punjab and Haryana, which was a pre-condition for the Green Revolution.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>4. New Agricultural Policy- Green Revolution </h2>
                <p>The Green Revolution refers to the dramatic increase in food grain production (especially wheat and rice) in the late 1960s and 1970s. It was a response to the severe food shortages and dependence on food aid (like PL-480 from the USA) in the mid-1960s.</p>

                <h3>The "Package" of Technology:</h3>
                <p>The Green Revolution was not just one thing; it was a package of inputs that had to be used together:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>High-Yielding Variety (HYV) Seeds:</strong> These were new, "miracle" seeds (developed by Norman Borlaug) that could produce much more grain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> The HYV seeds were highly responsive to fertilizers (N, P, K).</li>
                    <li><strong>Assured Irrigation:</strong> The new seeds and fertilizers required timely and controlled water supply, which meant investing in tubewells, pumps, and canals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pesticides and Herbicides:</strong> To protect the new, non-native plant varieties.</li>
                </ol>
