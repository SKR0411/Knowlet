                <h2>1. Incidence of Poverty in India </h2>
                <p>Poverty is the inability to fulfill the minimum requirements of life, including food, clothing, shelter, education, and health.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Poverty:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Absolute Poverty:</strong> A person is considered absolutely poor if their income or consumption falls *below* a minimum level (the "poverty line") required to meet basic needs. This is the definition used for most official measurements in India.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relative Poverty:</strong> A person is considered relatively poor if their income is significantly lower than the *average* income of society. This is a measure of inequality.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Incidence of Poverty:</strong> This is measured by the <strong>Headcount Ratio (HCR)</strong>, which is the percentage of the total population that lives below the poverty line.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Trend:</strong> The HCR in India has declined significantly, from over 55% in the 1970s to around 22% (Tendulkar Committee) or 29.5% (Rangarajan Committee) in 2011-12. However, due to the large population, the *absolute number* of poor people remains very high.</p>

                <h2>2. Estimates of Poverty and poverty line </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> The <strong>Poverty Line</strong> is a cut-off point, typically based on a minimum level of monthly consumption expenditure, that separates the "poor" from the "non-poor".
                </blockquote>

                <p>The estimation of this line has been a highly debated topic in India.</p>

                <h3>History of Poverty Line Estimation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Independence:</strong> Dadabhai Naoroji's "Jail Cost of Living" was an early attempt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alagh Committee (1979):</strong> This was the first official line based on nutrition. It was set at a daily calorie intake of <strong>2400 kcal (rural)</strong> and <strong>2100 kcal (urban)</strong>. The line was a monetary value (rupees) that was just enough to buy this calorie basket.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lakdawala Committee (1993):</strong> Continued the calorie-based approach but used state-specific price indices to create different poverty lines for each state.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tendulkar Committee (2009):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Major Shift:</strong> This committee moved *away* from a purely calorie-based model.</li>
                            <li>It created a new poverty line basket that included spending on <strong>health, education, and clothing</strong>, in addition to food.</li>
                            <li>Its poverty line was higher than the previous one, and it resulted in an HCR of 21.9% for 2011-12. This was the official line used by the previous government.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rangarajan Committee (2014):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It raised the poverty line even further, arguing that the Tendulkar line was too low.</li>
                            <li>This committee's estimates resulted in a higher HCR of 29.5% for 2011-12.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="common-mistake">
                    <strong>Poverty Line = Calorie Intake?</strong>
                    <p>It's a common mistake to say "the poverty line *is* 2400 calories." This is incorrect. The poverty line is a *monetary value* (e.g., Rs. 32 per day). In the *past* (Alagh Committee), this monetary value was calculated based on the cost of a 2400-calorie food basket. The Tendulkar and Rangarajan committees use a much broader basket of goods, not just calories.</p>

                <h2>3. Strategy of Poverty Alleviation </h2>
                <p>India's strategy to combat poverty has evolved over the decades and is often described as a "three-pronged" approach.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prong 1: Growth-Based Strategy ("Trickle-Down")</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Idea:</strong> Focus on achieving high GDP growth. The benefits of this growth (jobs, incomes, government tax revenue) will eventually "trickle down" to the poorest sections of society.</li>
                            <li><strong>Result:</strong> This was the primary strategy in the 1950s-70s. It was found to be too slow, and the benefits did not "trickle down" effectively.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Prong 2: Targeted Anti-Poverty Programmes</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Idea:</strong> Since growth alone is not enough, the government must create specific programmes that directly target the poor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Wage Employment:</strong> MGNREGA (provides a direct income floor).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Self-Employment:</strong> Programmes providing subsidized loans (like MUDRA) for the poor to start small businesses.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Prong 3: Providing Minimum Basic Amenities</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Idea:</strong> Focus on improving the *quality of life* and *human capital* of the poor, even if their income doesn't rise immediately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Public Distribution System (PDS) / National Food Security Act.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Health & Education:</strong> Public spending (e.g., NHM, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Other Amenities:</strong> Swachh Bharat (sanitation), PM Awas Yojana (housing), Ujjwala (cooking gas).</li>
                                </ul>

                <h2>4. Inequality-Income inequality in India: Magnitude and Nature </h2>
                <p>Inequality refers to the uneven distribution of income and/or wealth in a society. While poverty in India has declined, inequality has been *rising*.</p>
                
                <h3>Measuring Inequality:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gini Coefficient:</strong> The most common measure. It is a value between <strong>0 (perfect equality)</strong> and <strong>1 (perfect inequality)</strong>. India's Gini coefficient for income has been rising, indicating growing inequality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Income/Wealth Shares:</strong> Reports (like from Oxfam or the World Inequality Report) often show the share of national income or wealth held by the top 1% or top 10% of the population.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Magnitude and Nature:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rising Post-1991:</strong> The LPG reforms of 1991, while boosting economic growth, have also been a primary driver of rising inequality.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Top 1%" Capture Growth:</strong> A significant portion of the benefits of India's high GDP growth has been "captured" by the richest 1% and 10% of the population.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wealth vs. Income:</strong> **Wealth inequality** (unequal ownership of assets like land, stocks, property) is even more extreme than **income inequality** (unequal share of annual earnings).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>5. Growth and Inequality </h2>
                <p>The relationship between economic growth and inequality is famously described by the <strong>Kuznets Curve hypothesis</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>The Kuznets Curve (Inverted 'U' Hypothesis)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Idea:</strong> Simon Kuznets hypothesized that as a country begins to develop (moves from agriculture to industry), inequality first *increases*.</li>
                    <li>As the economy matures and becomes fully industrialized, inequality then *decreases*, forming an inverted 'U' shape.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong> In the early stages, a few people who move to high-paying industrial jobs get rich, while the majority stay in low-paying agriculture, widening the gap. In later stages, widespread education and social security systems help to reduce the gap.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="placeholder">
                    <p><strong>[Diagram: The Kuznets Curve (Inverted 'U')]</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>India's Context:</strong> India appears to be on the *rising* part of the Kuznets Curve. The post-1991 growth has been "skill-biased," favoring high-skilled workers (e.g., in IT, finance) over low-skilled workers, thereby increasing inequality.</p>

                <h2>6. Causes of income inequality </h2>
                <p>Inequality in India stems from several deep-rooted causes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Unequal Asset Distribution:</strong> Highly unequal ownership of physical assets (like land, property) and financial assets (like stocks, bonds). This is the primary cause.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inequality of Opportunity:</strong> Unequal access to quality <strong>education</strong> and <strong>healthcare</strong>. A child from a poor family and a child from a rich family do not start at the same point, perpetuating the cycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Large-scale wealth is passed down from one generation to the next.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill-Biased Growth:</strong> The new, high-growth service sector demands high skills, leaving behind the low-skilled majority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informal Sector Dominance:</strong> The majority of workers in the informal sector have no bargaining power, low wages, and no job security, while wages in the formal sector grow.</li>

                <h2>7. Government policies and measures </h2>
                <p>These are policies aimed at *reducing* the inequality gap (redistribution).</p>
                <div class="policy-focus">
                    <strong>Major Redistributive Policies:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Taxation:</strong> This is the main tool. The government taxes high-income individuals at a higher percentage (e.g., the income tax slabs) than low-income individuals. (Corporate taxes and wealth taxes also play a role).</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Spending (Expenditure Policy):</strong> The money collected from taxes is used to fund programmes for the poor.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Subsidies:</strong> Food, fertilizer, and fuel subsidies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Social Infrastructure:</strong> Public spending on health, education, and housing (e.g., PM Awas Yojana).</li>
                                <li><strong>Direct Transfers:</strong> Schemes like PM-KISAN, which directly transfer cash to farmers.</li>

                <h3>The Link:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unemployment as a Cause of Poverty:</strong> The most direct cause of poverty is the lack of a productive, well-paying, and regular job. Unemployment (or under-employment, like disguised unemployment) means low or no income, which leads directly to poverty (inability to afford basic needs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Poverty as a Cause of Unemployment:</strong> Poverty traps individuals. A poor person cannot afford good education or healthcare. This leads to poor human capital (low skills, poor health), making them unable to get high-paying jobs, thus trapping them in unemployment or low-wage informal work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Implication:</strong> This is why policies like **MGNREGA** are so important. They tackle *both* problems at once by providing employment (addressing unemployment) which generates income (addressing poverty).</li>
