                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Risk</strong> is defined as the uncertainty concerning the occurrence of a loss. It is the possibility of an unfavorable deviation from a desired outcome.
                </blockquote>
                <p>Insurance is concerned with <strong>Pure Risk</strong>, not all types of risk.</p>

                <h2>2. Managing Risk</h2>
                <p>Risk Management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an individual's or organization's well-being. There are four main techniques:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Risk Avoidance:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> Actively avoiding the risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Not buying a car to avoid the risk of a car accident. Not getting married to avoid the risk of divorce.</li>
                            <li><strong>Drawback:</strong> Often impractical or comes with a high opportunity cost.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Reduction (or Loss Control):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> Taking steps to reduce the *frequency* or *severity* of a loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Installing smoke detectors and fire extinguishers (reduces severity of fire), or wearing a seatbelt (reduces severity of injury).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Retention (or Self-Insurance):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> Knowingly accepting the risk and paying for any resulting losses yourself.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Deciding not to buy insurance for a minor risk, like a cracked phone screen (this is "active" retention). Or, not knowing about a risk (this is "passive" retention).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Transfer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What:</strong> Shifting the financial burden of a risk to another party.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> This is the core of insurance! You transfer the risk of a 1,000,000 hospital bill to an insurance company in exchange for a500 premium.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>3. Sources and Measurement of Risk</h2>
                
                <h3>Sources of Risk (Hazards)</h3>
                <p>A <strong>Hazard</strong> is a condition that increases the *probability* or *severity* of a loss. They are the sources of risk.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Hazard:</strong> A physical condition that increases the chance of loss.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A defective wire (fire hazard), an icy road (auto hazard), a cancerous tumor (health hazard).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Moral Hazard:</strong> Dishonesty or a defect in a person's character that leads them to *intentionally* cause a loss.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Intentionally burning down your own building to collect insurance money (arson).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Morale Hazard (or Attitudinal Hazard):</strong> Carelessness or indifference to a loss because you know you are insured.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Leaving your car unlocked with the keys inside *because* "it's insured anyway." Not wearing a seatbelt.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Measurement of Risk</h3>
                <p>Insurers measure risk by considering two factors:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Frequency (Probability):</strong> How likely is the loss to occur? (e.g., 1 in 1000 houses in this area will burn down this year).</li>
                    <li><strong>Severity (Amount):</strong> How large will the loss be if it occurs? (e.g., the average cost of a house fire is $200,000).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A risk with <strong>low frequency</strong> but <strong>high severity</strong> (like a house fire) is the ideal type of risk to insure. A risk with <strong>high frequency</strong> and <strong>low severity</strong> (like a papercut) is best managed by risk retention (self-insurance).</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="evaluation-prediction">
                <h2>4. Risk Evaluation and Prediction</h2>
                <p>This is the process by which insurers determine if a risk is insurable and what premium to charge.</p>

                <h3>The Law of Large Numbers (LLN)</h3>
                <p>This is the statistical principle that insurance is built on.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>LLN:</strong> As the number of exposure units (e.g., houses, cars) in a group increases, the actual (observed) loss experience will get closer and closer to the probable (expected) loss experience.
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>In English:</strong> You can't predict if *your* house will burn down this year. But an insurer, by looking at data for 1,000,000 houses, can predict with high accuracy that *around* 1,000 of them will.</li>
                    <li>This allows insurers to turn "uncertainty for the individual" into "certainty for the group," which makes the risk predictable and therefore insurable.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Process of Evaluation (Underwriting):</h3>
                <p><strong>Underwriting</strong> is the process of selecting, classifying, and pricing risks. The underwriter must evaluate the risk (e.g., you) to decide if you are a standard risk, a preferred risk (better than average), a substandard risk (worse than average), or an uninsurable risk.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="pooling-transfer">
                <h2>5. Risk pooling and Risk transfer</h2>
                <p>These are the two fundamental concepts that make insurance work.</p>

                <h3>Risk Transfer</h3>
                <p>As covered under risk management, this is the first step. The individual (insured) pays a <strong>premium</strong> to an insurance company (insurer). In exchange, the insurer agrees to accept the financial risk of a potential loss. The risk has been *transferred* from the insured to the insurer.</p>

                <h3>Risk Pooling (or Risk Sharing)</h3>
                <p>This is what the insurer does with all the risks it has accepted.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Risk Pooling:</strong> The process of combining all the premiums (from thousands of individuals) into a single "pool." This pool of money is then used to pay for the losses of the unfortunate few who suffer a loss.
                </blockquote>
                
                <div class="placeholder">
                    <p><strong></strong></p>
                </div>
                
                <p>In essence, insurance is a system where the <strong>losses of the few are shared by the many</strong>. The premium paid by each person is their share of the group's total expected losses. This is the "how" risk transfer is made financially viable.</p>
