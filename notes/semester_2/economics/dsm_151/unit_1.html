                <h2>1. Micro Economics: Meaning, Nature, Scope, Importance, Limitations</h2>
                
                <h3>Meaning</h3>
                <p><strong>Microeconomics</strong> (from the Greek word 'mikros' meaning 'small') is the branch of economics that studies the behavior of **individual economic units** and their interactions in specific markets. It focuses on the "small picture."</p>
                <p>Examples of units studied:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A single consumer (household)</li>
                        <li>A single firm (business)</li>
                        <li>A single market (e.g., the market for coffee)</li>
                        <li>A single industry (e.g., the auto industry)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Nature</h3>
                <p>Microeconomics is primarily a **theoretical and analytical** science. It uses models and assumptions (like *ceteris paribus* - "all else being equal") to understand how individuals make decisions and how prices are determined. It is often called **"Price Theory"** because its main goal is to explain how the prices of goods, services, and factors of production are determined.</p>

                <h3>Scope (What does it study?)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Theory of Consumer Behavior:</strong> How a consumer decides what to buy to maximize their satisfaction (utility).</li>
                    <li><strong>Theory of the Firm (Production & Cost):</strong> How a firm decides what to produce and how to produce it to minimize cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Theory of Market Structures:</strong> How prices and output are determined in different markets (e.g., perfect competition, monopoly).</li>
                    <li><strong>Factor Pricing:</strong> How the prices of factors of production (land, labor, capital) are determined (i.e., rent, wages, interest).</li>
                    <li><strong>Welfare Economics:</strong> The study of economic efficiency and social welfare.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Importance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helps in understanding the working of a free-market economy.</li>
                    <li>Provides the basis for business decisions (e.g., pricing, production).</li>
                    <li>Serves as the foundation for government policies (e.g., taxation, subsidies).</li>
                    <li>Forms the basis for understanding more complex macroeconomic issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Partial Equilibrium" Analysis:</strong> It often studies one market in isolation, ignoring the knock-on effects in other markets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unrealistic Assumptions:</strong> It relies on assumptions like "perfect competition" and "perfectly rational consumers," which may not hold true in the real world.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Fallacy of Composition":</strong> What is true for an individual (micro) may not be true for the whole economy (macro). For example, saving is good for one person, but if *everyone* saves, it can cause a recession.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="basic-problems">
                <h2>2. Basic Problems of Economics: Scarcity and Choice</h2>
                <p>The entire field of economics exists because of one fundamental problem: **scarcity**.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Scarcity:</strong> The basic economic problem that arises because people have **unlimited wants** but resources are **limited (scarce)**.
                </blockquote>
                <p>Because of scarcity, we cannot have everything we want. This forces us to make a **choice**. Economics is the study of how people, firms, and governments make choices to allocate their scarce resources.</p>
                
                <h3>The Three Basic (or Central) Problems of an Economy:</h3>
                <p>Every society, regardless of its political system, must answer three basic questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>What to produce?</strong> (Which goods? Cars or tanks? Wheat or computers?)</li>
                    <li><strong>How to produce?</strong> (Which technology? Labor-intensive (using more workers) or capital-intensive (using more machines)?)</li>
                    <li><strong>For whom to produce?</strong> (Who gets the goods? How is the national income distributed?)</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="opportunity-cost">
                <h2>3. Choice and Opportunity Cost</h2>
                <p>When you make a choice, you must give up something else. The value of what you give up is the opportunity cost.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> The value of the **next-best alternative foregone** when a choice is made.
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example 1 (Consumer):</strong> If you have 10 and you choose to buy a book, you give up the chance to buy a movie ticket. The movie ticket is your opportunity cost.</li> <li><strong>Example 2 (Government):</strong> If the government spends100 million building a new highway, the opportunity cost is the hospital or school it could have built with that same $100 million.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="exam-tip">
                  <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Opportunity cost is not *all* the alternatives, only the *next best* one. If your choices are (1) College, (2) Job, (3) Travel, and you choose (1) College, your opportunity cost is (2) Job (assuming that was your second-best choice), not both the job and travel.
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="ppf">
                <h2>4. Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)</h2>
                <p>The **Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)** (or Production Possibility Curve, PPC) is a graph that illustrates the concepts of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost.</p>
                <p>It shows the **maximum combinations of two goods** that an economy can produce, given its available resources and technology.</p>

                <div class="placeholder">
                    <p><strong></strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>What the PPF Shows:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Represented by the boundary itself. Any point *outside* the curve (like Point C) is **unattainable** with current resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> Any point *on* the curve (like Point B) represents a specific choice. To get more of Good B, you must choose to have less of Good A.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:Free
                    <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Represented by an **outward shift** of the entire PPF curve, which can be caused by new technology or an increase in resources (like labor or capital).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why is the PPF concave (bowed outwards)?</h3>
                <p>The PPF is concave because of the **Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost**. As you produce more and more of one good (e.g., Butter), you have to give up *increasingly larger* amounts of the other good (e.g., Guns). This is because resources are not perfectly adaptable. The workers and machines best suited for making Guns are moved last to making Butter, and they are very inefficient at it.</p>

                <h3 id="demand">7.1 Law of Demand</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Law of Demand:</strong> Ceteris paribus (all else being equal), as the <b>price</b> of a good <b>falls</b>, the <b>quantity demanded</b> for that good <b>rises</b>. And as the price rises, the quantity demanded falls.
                </blockquote>
                <p>This is an <strong>inverse relationship</strong>, which is why the demand curve slopes <strong>downwards</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Movement vs. Shift:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <strong>change in price</strong> causes a <strong>movement *along*</strong> the demand curve (called "change in quantity demanded").</li>
                            <li>A <strong>change in any other factor</strong> causes a <strong>*shift*</strong> of the entire demand curve (called "change in demand").</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Determinants of Demand (Factors that shift the curve):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Income of consumers:</strong> (Increases for *normal goods*, decreases for *inferior goods*).</li>
                            <li><strong>Prices of related goods:</strong> (Increases for *substitutes* like Coke/Pepsi; decreases for *complements* like car/petrol).</li>
                            <li><strong>Tastes and preferences.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Expectations of future prices.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exceptions to the Law of Demand:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Giffen Goods:</strong> Highly inferior goods (e.g., basic staple food for the very poor) where a price rise leads to a rise in demand because the income effect outweighs the substitution effect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Veblen Goods (Snob Effect):</strong> Luxury goods (e.g., diamonds, Rolex watches) that are demanded *because* they are expensive. A higher price signals higher status.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="supply">7.2 Law of Supply</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Law of Supply:</strong> Ceteris paribus, as the <b>price</b> of a good <b>rises</b>, the <b>quantity supplied</b> of that good <b>rises</b>. And as the price falls, the quantity supplied falls.
                </blockquote>
                <p>This is a <strong>direct relationship</strong> (higher price = higher profit incentive), which is why the supply curve slopes <strong>upwards</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Determinants of Supply (Factors that shift the curve):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Input prices</strong> (cost of labor, raw materials).</li>
                            <li><strong>Technology</strong> (better technology shifts supply to the right).</li>
                            <li><strong>Taxes and subsidies.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Expectations of future prices.</strong></li>

                <h3 id="market-equilibrium">7.3 Market Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Demand/Supply:</strong> The horizontal summation of all individual demand/supply curves in the market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Equilibrium:</strong> The point where the market demand curve intersects the market supply curve.
                        <ul>
                            <li>At this point, <strong>Quantity Demanded = Quantity Supplied</strong>.</li>
                            <li>This determines the <strong>equilibrium price (P*)</strong> and <strong>equilibrium quantity (Q*)</strong>.</li>

                <h3 id="elasticity">7.4 Elasticity of Demand and Supply</h3>
                <p><strong>Elasticity</strong> measures the <strong>responsiveness</strong> (or sensitivity) of one variable to a change in another.</p>
                <p><strong>Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):</strong> Measures how much <strong>quantity demanded</strong> responds to a change in <strong>price</strong>.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    PED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)

                </table>
                <p><strong>Price Elasticity of Supply (PES):</strong> Measures how much <strong>quantity supplied</strong> responds to a change in <strong>price</strong>. The main determinant is <strong>time</strong>: supply is more elastic in the long run.</p>
