                <h2>1. Money: Definition, types, and functions</h2> 
                
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p><strong>Money</strong> is anything that is **generally accepted** as a medium of exchange for goods and services and for the settlement of debts.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Money</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commodity Money:</strong> An item with intrinsic value (value in itself), like gold, silver, or salt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fiat Money:</strong> An item with no intrinsic value (like a paper note) that is declared by government decree ("fiat") to be legal tender. This is what we use today.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fiduciary Money (or Bank Money):</strong> A promise to pay, like a cheque or a bank deposit. It works based on "fiducia" (trust) that the bank will honor it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Functions of Money</h3>
                <p>This is a classic exam question. Money has four main functions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Medium of Exchange:</strong> This is its primary function. Money solves the "double coincidence of wants" problem of the barter system. You don't have to find someone who has what you want *and* wants what you have.</li>
                    <li><strong>Measure of Value (or Unit of Account):</strong> Money provides a common yardstick for measuring and comparing the value of different goods and services (e.g., this car is worth 20,000, this apple is1).</li>
                    <li><strong>Store of Value:</strong> Money allows you to save your purchasing power for the future. (Note: Inflation can erode its value).</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard of Deferred Payment:</strong> Money is a standard way to express the value of a debt or a future payment (e.g., "Pay 100 in 30 days").</li> </ol> </section> <section id="money-supply-demand"> <h2>2. Determination and Measurement of money supply and demand</h2> <h3>Determination of Money Demand</h3> <p>As covered in Unit 4, the demand for money (Liquidity Preference) is determined by:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Income (Y):</strong> Positively related (for Transaction and Precautionary motives).</li> <li><strong>Interest Rate (i):</strong> Negatively related (for the Speculative motive).</li> </ul> <p>The **money market** reaches equilibrium at the interest rate where Money Demand (M<sub>D</sub>) equals Money Supply (M<sub>S</sub>).</p> <h3>Measurement of Money Supply</h3> <p>The money supply is the total stock of money in circulation in an economy. The central bank (RBI in India) measures this using different "monetary aggregates":</p> <ul> <li><strong>M1 (Narrow Money):</strong> This is the most liquid form of money. <blockquote><strong>M1 = C + DD + OD</strong> <br><strong>C</strong> = Currency (notes and coins) held by the public. <br><strong>DD</strong> = Demand Deposits (chequing accounts) with banks. <br><strong>OD</strong> = Other Deposits with the RBI. </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>M2 = M1 +</strong> Deposits with Post Office savings banks.</li> <li><strong>M3 (Broad Money):</strong> This is the most common measure of money supply. <blockquote><strong>M3 = M1 + Time Deposits with banks</strong> <br>(Time Deposits are fixed deposits, or FDs, which are less liquid). </blockquote> </li> <li><strong>M4 = M3 +</strong> Total Post Office deposits.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="commercial-bank"> <h2>3. Functions of Commercial bank</h2> <p>A commercial bank (like SBI, HDFC, ICICI) is a financial institution whose main business is to accept deposits and give loans, with the aim of making a profit.</p> <h3>Primary Functions:</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Accepting Deposits:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Demand Deposits (Current/Chequing Accounts):</strong> Payable on demand, no interest.</li> <li><strong>Time Deposits (Fixed Deposits, FDs):</strong> Deposited for a fixed term (e.g., 1 year), pay higher interest.</li> <li><strong>Savings Deposits:</strong> A hybrid, allowing chequing but also paying a small amount of interest.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Advancing Loans:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Cash Credit/Overdraft:</strong> Allowing businesses to borrow against their assets.</li> <li><strong>Term Loans:</strong> For purchasing machinery, cars, houses (e.g., a home loan).</li> <li><strong>Discounting Bills of Exchange:</strong> Providing cash to a business immediately for a bill that is due in the future.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h3>Secondary Functions:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Agency Functions:</strong> Acting as an *agent* for the customer (e.g., transferring funds, paying bills, collecting cheques).</li> <li><strong>General Utility Functions:</strong> (e.g., providing locker facilities, issuing debit/credit cards, foreign exchange).</li> </ul> </section> <section id="credit-creation"> <h2>4. Credit creation</h2> <p>This is the most important *macroeconomic* function of commercial banks. It is the process by which banks <strong>"create" new money (deposits)</strong> in the economy by making loans.</p> <p>This process is based on two assumptions: <ol> <li>All transactions are routed through banks.</li> <li>Banks are required by the central bank to hold a certain fraction of their deposits as reserves (<strong>Cash Reserve Ratio, or CRR</strong>) and must loan out the rest.</li> </ol> </p> <h3>How it Works (The Money Multiplier):</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Example:</strong> Assume <strong>CRR = 10%</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Person A deposits <strong>1000</strong> in Bank 1.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bank 1 keeps 10% (100) as reserves and loans out <strong>900</strong> to Person B.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Person B uses the 900 to buy something, and the seller deposits it in Bank 2.</li> <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Bank 2 keeps 10% (90) as reserves and loans out <strong>810</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> This810 is deposited in Bank 3, which keeps 10% (81) and loans out <strong>729</strong>...</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> The initial 1000 deposit has *created* new loans and deposits of900 + 810 +729...
                <br>The total amount of deposits created will be:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <span class="formula"><strong>Total Deposits = Initial Deposit * (1 / CRR)</strong></span>
                    <br>Total Deposits = 1000 * (1 / 0.10) =1000 * 10 = <strong>$10,000</strong>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The <strong>Money Multiplier</strong> is (1 / CRR). In this case, it is 10.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="central-bank">
                <h2>5. Role of central bank</h2> 
                <p>A <strong>central bank</strong> (like the <strong>Reserve Bank of India, or RBI</strong>) is the apex financial institution in a country. It is *not* a for-profit bank; its goal is to manage the country's money supply and banking system to ensure stability and growth.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Functions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Monopoly of Note Issue:</strong> It is the *only* authority with the right to issue currency (paper notes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Banker to the Government:</strong> It manages the government's bank accounts, makes payments on its behalf, and issues government bonds (manages public debt).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bankers' Bank:</strong> It acts as a bank for all the commercial banks.
                        <ul>
                            <li>All banks must keep deposits with the central bank (CRR).</li>
                            <li>It acts as a <strong>"Lender of Last Resort"</strong>—if a commercial bank is in trouble, the central bank will lend to it to prevent a collapse.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Custodian of Foreign Exchange:</strong> It manages the country's reserves of foreign currency (e.g., US Dollars, Euros) and manages the exchange rate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Controller of Credit:</strong> This is its most important function. It controls the total amount of money and credit in the economy using <strong>Monetary Policy</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            
            <section id="credit-control">
                <h2>6. Credit control- tools of monetary policy</h2> 
                <p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong> refers to the actions taken by the central bank to control the money supply and interest rates, with the goal of achieving macroeconomic objectives like <strong>price stability (controlling inflation)</strong> and <strong>economic growth</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>The tools can be divided into two types:</p>
                
                <h3>A. Quantitative Tools (General)</h3>
                <p>These tools affect the *total volume* of credit in the economy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bank Rate (or Repo Rate):</strong> The interest rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>To fight inflation:</strong> *Increase* the bank rate. This makes borrowing expensive, slows down lending, and reduces the money supply.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Open Market Operations (OMOs):</strong> The buying and selling of government bonds by the central bank.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>To fight inflation:</strong> *Sell* bonds. This sucks money *out* of the economy (as people give their money to the central bank) and reduces the money supply.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):</strong> The percentage of deposits that banks *must* keep with the central bank.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>To fight inflation:</strong> *Increase* the CRR (e.g., from 10% to 20%). This forces banks to hold more and lend less, shrinking the money multiplier and the money supply.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR):</strong> The percentage of deposits that banks must keep with *themselves* in the form of liquid assets (cash, gold, bonds).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>B. Qualitative Tools (Selective)</h3>
                <p>These tools target the *use* or *direction* of credit for specific sectors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Margin Requirements:</strong> The percentage of a loan's value that the borrower must pay themselves (e.g., a 20% margin on a car loan means the bank will only lend 80%). Increasing the margin discourages borrowing for that specific item.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moral Suasion:</strong> The central bank "persuades" or pressures commercial banks (through letters or meetings) to follow its policy, e.g., "please don't lend so much for speculation."</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Action:</strong> Punishing a bank that does not follow the central bank's directives.</li>
                </ul>
