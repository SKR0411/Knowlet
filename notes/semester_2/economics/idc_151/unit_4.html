                <h2>1. [cite_start]Keynes' objections to classical theory</h2> [cite: 596]
                <p>John Maynard Keynes, writing during the Great Depression of the 1930s, saw that the Classical model had failed. Millions were unemployed, and the economy was *not* automatically returning to full employment.</p>
                
                <h3>Keynes's Main Objections:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Say's Law:</strong> Keynes argued that Say's Law ("Supply creates its own demand") was wrong. He famously argued that **Demand creates its own supply**. He showed that savings might *not* automatically equal investment. If people save, that is a "leakage" from the circular flow, and if it isn't matched by an "injection" of investment, aggregate demand will be deficient, leading to a recession.</li>
                    [cite_start]<li><strong>Wages and Prices are *Not* Flexible:</strong> Keynes argued that in the real world, wages are **"sticky downwards."** Workers and trade unions will resist wage cuts, even during a recession[cite: 596].
                        <ul>
                            <li>Therefore, the Classical "automatic fix" (falling wages) will not work.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The "Liquidity Trap":</strong> He argued that even if the central bank lowered interest rates to zero, savings might *still* be greater than investment. People might just hoard cash (liquidity) out of fear, and firms won't invest if they have no confidence in future sales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full Employment is Not Guaranteed:</strong> The Classical model said the economy is *always* at full employment. Keynes showed that the economy could get stuck in an **"under-employment equilibrium"**—a stable state with high unemployment.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            
            <section id="keynesian-approach">
                <h2>2. [cite_start]The Keynesian Approach</h2> [cite: 596]
                <p>The Keynesian approach flips the Classical model on its head.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the Classical model, <strong>Supply</strong> is key, and the economy is at full employment.</li>
                    <li>In the Keynesian model, <strong>Aggregate Demand (AD)</strong> is key, and the economy can be at *any* level of employment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Keynes's Central Idea:</strong> The total level of **output (GDP) and employment** in the economy is determined by the level of **Aggregate Demand (AD)**.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If AD is high, firms will produce more and hire more workers.</li>
                    <li>If AD is low (deficient), firms will produce less and fire workers, leading to a recession and unemployment.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="consumption-function">
                <h2>3. [cite_start]Keynesian Consumption Function</h2> [cite: 596]
                <p>Keynes argued that the most important component of Aggregate Demand is <strong>Consumption (C)</strong>. He proposed a "fundamental psychological law" to describe how households consume.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <span class="formula"><strong>C = a + bY</strong></span>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C</strong> = Total Consumption</li>
                    <li><strong>a</strong> = <strong>Autonomous Consumption</strong>: The minimum amount of consumption households will do even if their income (Y) is zero (by borrowing or using savings). This is the C-intercept.</li>
                    <li><strong>Y</strong> = Total Income (specifically, disposable income)</li>
                    <li><strong>b</strong> = <strong>Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)</strong>: The fraction of each *additional* dollar of income that is spent on consumption.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>MPC = (Change in C) / (Change in Y)</strong></li>
                            <li>Keynes argued that <strong>0 < MPC < 1</strong> (e.g., if MPC = 0.8, you will spend 80 cents of every new dollar you get and save 20 cents).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </section>
            
            <section id="saving-investment">
                <h2>4. [cite_start]Saving, Investment Functions</h2> [cite: 596]

                <h3>Saving Function (S)</h3>
                <p>Saving is simply the part of income that is *not* consumed.
                <br>Y = C + S  =>  <strong>S = Y - C</strong></p>
                <p>We can derive the saving function from the consumption function:
                <br>S = Y - (a + bY)
                <br>S = Y - a - bY
                </p><blockquote>
                    <span class="formula"><strong>S = -a + (1 - b)Y</strong></span>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>-a</strong> = Autonomous Dissaving: The amount you must borrow or take from savings when income is zero.</li>
                    <li><strong>(1 - b)</strong> = <strong>Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)</strong>: The fraction of each *additional* dollar of income that is saved.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>MPS = (Change in S) / (Change in Y)</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="exam-tip">
                    <strong>Key Relationship:</strong>
                    <br>Since every new dollar must be either consumed or saved:
                    <br><strong>MPC + MPS = 1</strong>
                    <br>(e.g., if MPC = 0.8, then MPS must = 0.2)
                </div>

                <h3>Investment Function (I)</h3>
                <p>Keynes argued that Investment (spending by firms on capital) is the most unstable part of AD. He treated it as **autonomous (independent) of income**.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <span class="formula"><strong>I = I₀</strong></span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This means investment is a fixed amount (e.g., $100 billion) determined by business confidence ("animal spirits") and the interest rate, not by the current level of GDP.</p>
            </section><section id="ad-as">
                <h2>5. [cite_start]Basics of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply</h2> [cite: 596]
                <p>This is the main framework for the Keynesian model.</p>
                
                <h3>Aggregate Demand (AD)</h3>
                <p>AD is the total planned spending in the economy. In a simple two-sector model (households and firms):</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <span class="formula"><strong>AD = C + I</strong></span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="formula"><strong>AD = (a + bY) + I₀</strong></span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The AD curve is upward sloping because as Income (Y) rises, Consumption (C) also rises.</p>

                <h3>Aggregate Supply (AS)</h3>
                <p>In the Keynesian model, the AS curve is a <strong>45-degree line</strong>.
                <br>This line represents all points where **Total Spending (AD) = Total Income/Output (Y)**.
                <br>It's a graphical representation of the equilibrium condition (Y = AD).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="effective-demand">
                <h2>6. [cite_start]The Principle of Effective Demand</h2> [cite: 596]
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Principle of Effective Demand:</strong> The equilibrium level of income and employment in the economy is determined by the point where **Aggregate Demand (AD) equals Aggregate Supply (AS)**.
                </blockquote>
                <p>This intersection point is the <strong>"effective demand."</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If AD > AS (Spending > Output): Firms' inventories will fall, so they will hire more workers and produce more, causing Y to rise.</li>
                    <li>If AD < AS (Spending < Output): Firms' inventories will pile up, so they will fire workers and produce less, causing Y to fall.</li>
                    <li>Equilibrium is only reached when <strong>AD = AS</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="common-mistake">
                    Keynes's main point is that this equilibrium (AD=AS) can happen at *any* level of output, not just at the full-employment level. This is how he explains an "under-employment equilibrium."

                <p>This is the process of finding the equilibrium income (Y) using algebra. There are two identical methods:</p>
                
                <h3>Method 1: AD = AS (Aggregate Demand = Aggregate Supply)</h3>
                <ol><li>Start with the equilibrium condition: <strong>Y = AD</strong></li>

                    <li>Substitute the functions: <strong>Y = (a + bY) + I₀</strong></li>
                    <li>Solve for Y:

                <p>The multiplier is one of Keynes's most important concepts. It explains why a small change in spending can have a much larger effect on national income.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>The Multiplier (k):</strong> The ratio of the change in equilibrium income (ΔY) to the initial change in autonomous spending (e.g., ΔI) that caused it.

                    <strong>k = ΔY / ΔI</strong>

                <h3>How it Works:</h3>
                <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Assume MPC = 0.8 (so MPS = 0.2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiplier (k) = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> The government or a firm invests $100 in building a new road (ΔI = $100).</li>
                    <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> The $100 is paid as income to workers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> The workers spend 80% of it (MPC=0.8), so they spend $80. This becomes income for a shopkeeper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Round 3:</strong> The shopkeeper spends 80% of that $80, which is $64. This becomes income for someone else.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The initial $100 injection of spending leads to a total increase in income of $100 + $80 + $64 + ... which will eventually sum to <strong>$500</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>ΔY = k * ΔI  =>  $500 = 5 * $100</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. [cite_start]Keynesian theory of demand for money</h2> [cite: 597]
                <p>Keynes's theory of money demand is called the **Liquidity Preference Theory**. He asked: Why do people *prefer* to hold *liquid* assets (like cash) instead of interest-bearing assets (like bonds)?</p>
                <p>He gave three motives for demanding (holding) money:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Motive (L<sub>T</sub>):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Holding money for day-to-day purchases (food, rent, bus fare).</li>
                            <li>This depends positively on the level of <strong>Income (Y)</strong>. (More income = more transactions).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Precautionary Motive (L<sub>P</sub>):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Holding money for unforeseen emergencies (medical bills, car repairs).</li>
                            <li>This also depends positively on the level of <strong>Income (Y)</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Speculative Motive (L<sub>S</sub>):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This was Keynes's big innovation.</li>
                            <li>Holding money as a financial asset, to "speculate" on the future of the <strong>interest rate (i)</strong>.</li>
                            <li>There is an <em>inverse</em> relationship between the interest rate and bond prices.</li>
                            <li><strong>If i is high:</strong> You expect it to fall. You buy bonds (money demand is low).</li>
                            <li><strong>If i is low:</strong> You expect it to rise. You sell your bonds and hold cash (money demand is high), to avoid the capital loss when bond prices fall.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Total Money Demand (M<sub>D</sub>) = L(Y, i)</strong>
                    <br>
                    (M<sub>D</sub> depends positively on Income and negatively on the Interest Rate)
