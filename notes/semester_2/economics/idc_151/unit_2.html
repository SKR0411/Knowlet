                <h2>1. Concept of GNP, GDP, NNP, NDP</h2> 
                <p>These are the core aggregates used to measure a country's economic output.</p>
                
                <h3>GDP (Gross Domestic Product)</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>GDP:</strong> The total <strong>market value</strong> of all <strong>final</strong> goods and services produced <strong>within the domestic territory</strong> of a country in a given year.
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Domestic":</strong> This is the key word. It includes output produced by foreign-owned companies *inside* India (e.g., a Hyundai factory in Chennai) but *excludes* output produced by Indian-owned companies *outside* India (e.g., a Tata factory in the UK).</li>
                    <li><strong>"Final":</strong> This means we only count the final product (e.g., a car) and not the intermediate goods (e.g., tires, steel) used to make it. This avoids "double counting."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>GNP (Gross National Product)</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>GNP:</strong> The total market value of all final goods and services produced in a given year by the <strong>nationals (citizens)</strong> of a country, regardless of where they are located.
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"National":</strong> This is the key word. It *excludes* output by foreign companies in India but *includes* output by Indian companies and citizens working abroad.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Link:</strong>
                        <blockquote><strong>GNP = GDP + NFIA</strong></blockquote>
                        <strong>NFIA = Net Factor Income from Abroad</strong> (Income earned by nationals abroad - Income earned by foreigners domestically).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>"Net" vs. "Gross" (The concept of Depreciation)</h3>
                <p><strong>Depreciation</strong> (or Consumption of Fixed Capital) is the wear and tear on the country's capital stock (machines, factories) as it is used to produce output.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gross</strong> means depreciation has *not* been subtracted. It is the total output.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net</strong> means depreciation *has* been subtracted. It represents the true addition to a country's wealth.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Net = Gross - Depreciation</strong>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>NNP (Net National Product)</h3>
                <p><strong>NNP = GNP - Depreciation</strong>
                <br>NNP is considered a more accurate measure of a country's true income. <strong>NNP at Factor Cost</strong> is the same as <strong>National Income</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>NDP (Net Domestic Product)</h3>
                <p><strong>NDP = GDP - Depreciation</strong></p>

                <h2>2. Private income, Personal income, Per capita income</h2> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Private Income:</strong> The total income earned by the private sector (households and private firms) from all sources, including factor incomes and transfer payments from the government.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Income (PI):</strong> The total income *received* by households before they pay personal income taxes. This is the income they can actually use.
                        <blockquote><strong>PI = Private Income - Corporate Taxes - Retained Earnings (Undistributed Profits)</strong></blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Disposable Income (PDI):</strong> The income households have left *after* paying direct taxes (like income tax). This is the money they can actually spend (Consume) or Save.
                        <blockquote><strong>PDI = Personal Income - Personal Direct Taxes</strong>
                        <br><strong>PDI = Consumption + Saving</strong></blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Per Capita Income (PCI):</strong> The average income per person in the country.
                        <blockquote><strong>PCI = National Income / Total Population</strong></blockquote>
                        This is a better measure of economic welfare than total National Income, as it accounts for population size.
                    </li>

                <h2>4. Methods of measuring national income</h2> 
                <p>There are three ways to measure GDP. In theory, all three must give the exact same answer because one person's spending is another person's income, which is generated from producing a product.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Production (or Value-Added) Method:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How:</strong> Sums up the <strong>value added</strong> by all firms at each stage of production.</li>
                            <li><strong>Value Added = Value of Output - Value of Intermediate Goods</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Why:</strong> This avoids the "problem of double counting." We don't just add the value of bread + the value of flour + the value of wheat. We only add the *value added* at each step.</li>

                            <li><strong>How:</strong> Sums up all the <strong>factor incomes</strong> paid by firms to households.</li>
                            <li>It adds up all the rewards for the factors of production:
                                <blockquote><strong>NI = Wages (for Labor) + Rent (for Land) + Interest (for Capital) + Profits (for Entrepreneurship)</strong></blockquote>

                <h2>5. Difficulties of Estimating National Income</h2> 
                <p>Measuring GDP accurately is extremely difficult, especially in a developing country with a large informal sector.</p>
                <h3>Common Problems:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem of Double Counting:</strong> If the value of intermediate goods (like flour) is not carefully excluded, it will be counted twice (once as flour, and again as part of the bread), inflating the GDP figure.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Informal/Unorganized Sector:</strong> A very large part of the economy (street vendors, small shops, daily wage laborers) is not formally registered. Their income and output are very hard to track and are often "guesstimated."</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Monetized Economy:</strong> Many transactions are not paid for with money (barter system). For example, a farmer who grows food for his own family. This is "production" but does not enter the market, making it hard to value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Reliable Data:</strong> People may not keep accurate accounts or may intentionally under-report income to avoid taxes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Market Services:</strong> The services of a homemaker (cooking, cleaning, childcare) are extremely valuable but are not included in GDP because they are not paid a market salary.</li>

                <h2>6. National income and economic welfare</h2> 
                <p><strong>Economic welfare</strong> refers to the overall well-being and standard of living of the population. A high GDP (or per capita income) is often used as a proxy for high welfare, but it is a poor and incomplete measure.</p>
                
                <h3>Limitations of GDP as an Indicator of Welfare:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Distribution of Income:</strong> GDP per capita is just an average. The country's GDP could be very high, but if all the income goes to 1% of the population (high inequality), the welfare of the average citizen is low.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition of Output:</strong> GDP includes all production. An economy producing 1 billion of cigarettes and tanks has the same GDP as one producing1 billion of schools and hospitals, but the welfare implications are very different.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Monetized Activities:</strong> As mentioned, GDP ignores unpaid work like homemaking, volunteering, and leisure time, all of which are crucial for welfare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Externalities (Side Effects):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Negative Externalities:</strong> GDP *adds* the value of a factory's output but does not *subtract* the cost of the pollution it creates, which lowers welfare.</li>
                            <li><strong>Positive Externalities:</strong> A public park or scientific research increases welfare but may not be fully captured in GDP.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>7. Circular flow of income in two, three and four sector economy</h2> 
                <p>This is a simple model that shows how income and spending flow through the economy between the different sectors. (This is a visual representation of the sector models from Unit 1).</p>
                
                <h3>Two-Sector Model (Households & Firms)</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real Flow:</strong> Households supply <strong>Factors of Production</strong> (labor, land) to Firms. Firms supply <strong>Goods and Services</strong> to Households.</li>
                    <li><strong>Money Flow:</strong> Firms pay <strong>Factor Incomes</strong> (wages, rent) to Households. Households use this money for <strong>Consumption Expenditure</strong> to buy goods from firms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Injections & Leakages:</strong> To make it realistic, we add:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Leakage:</strong> Savings (S) - Money households *don't* spend.</li>
                            <li><strong>Injection:</strong> Investment (I) - Money firms *borrow* (from savings) to spend.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Three-Sector Model (Adds Government)</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Leakage:</strong> Taxes (T) - Money paid to the government.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Injection:</strong> Government Spending (G) - Money the government spends.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Four-Sector Model (Adds Foreign Sector)</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Leakage:</strong> Imports (M) - Money spent on foreign goods.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Injection:</strong> Exports (X) - Money foreigners spend on our goods.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="exam-tip">
                    For the economy to be in equilibrium, <strong>Total Leakages must equal Total Injections</strong>.
                    <blockquote><strong>S + T + M = I + G + X</strong></blockquote>
