        <h2 id="topic1">Infrastructure</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>This includes all the basic equipment and facilities needed for mushroom cultivation, from small-scale home growing to a larger operation[cite: 428].</p>
        
        <h3>Growing Structures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mushroom Unit (Thatched House):</strong> A low-cost, traditional structure made from bamboo and thatch (like paddy straw). [cite_start]It helps maintain humidity and protects from direct sunlight and rain[cite: 428].</li>
            <li><strong>Culture Rack:</strong> Shelves (usually made of bamboo or wood) inside the mushroom house to hold the mushroom beds or polybags in tiers, maximizing the use of space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Substrates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally Available Substrates:</strong> The bulk organic material that the mushroom mycelium will grow on and use as food. [cite_start]Common examples are paddy straw, wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, sawdust, and banana leaves[cite: 428, 431].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Equipment for Preparation and Growing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low-cost Stove / Drum:</strong> Used for boiling water and pasteurizing (partially sterilizing) the substrate (e.g., boiling straw to kill competitor molds).</li>
            <li><strong>Sieves:</strong> For draining water from the substrate after boiling.</li>
            <li><strong>Vessels:</strong> Large pots or tubs for soaking and boiling the substrate.</li>
            <li><strong>Polythene Bag:</strong> The most common container for growing oyster mushrooms. [cite_start]The substrate and spawn are packed inside[cite: 428].</li>
            <li><strong>Small polythene bag:</strong> Can be used for preparing or storing spawn.</li>
            <li><strong>Tray:</strong> Used for growing button mushrooms (<i>Agaricus</i>) on compost beds.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Sprayer:</strong> Essential for maintaining high humidity (80-90%) in the mushroom house by misting the air and bags.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tools for Inoculation</h3>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Inoculation Hook / Inoculation Loop:</strong> Tools used in a sterile lab environment to transfer the pure fungal culture (mycelium) from one petri dish or test tube to another, or to the spawn substrate[cite: 428]. They are sterilized in a flame before each use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="topic2">Pure-culture: Medium and Sterilization</h2>
        
        <h3>Pure Culture</h3>
        <p>A <strong>pure culture</strong> is a laboratory culture that contains only a single, known species of fungus (e.g., <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>), free from all contaminants like bacteria or other molds.</p>
        <p>Starting with a pure culture is <strong>essential</strong> for successful cultivation. If you start with a contaminated culture, the contaminants will out-compete the mushroom, and the crop will fail.</p>
        
        <h3>Medium</h3>
        <p>A <strong>medium</strong> (or growth medium) is the nutrient-rich substance used in the laboratory to grow the pure culture. A common medium for fungi is <strong>Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potato:</strong> Provides starch and minerals.</li>
            <li><strong>Dextrose (Glucose):</strong> Provides a simple sugar for energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Agar:</strong> A gelatin-like substance from seaweed, used to make the medium solid (like in a Petri dish).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sterilization</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Sterilization</strong> is the process of killing <strong>all</strong> forms of life and their spores (e.g., bacteria, fungi, endospores) from the medium or equipment.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a <strong>critical step</strong>. The nutrient-rich medium will grow contaminants much faster than the mushroom mycelium if it is not sterile.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> The medium (e.g., PDA in a flask) and glassware are sterilized using an <strong>Autoclave</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Parameters:</strong> The autoclave uses high-pressure steam at <strong>121°C</strong> and <strong>15 psi</strong> (pounds per square inch) pressure for 15-20 minutes. This is the only reliable way to kill heat-resistant bacterial endospores.</li>
            <li><strong>Aseptic Technique:</strong> After sterilization, all transfers (e.rowing the pure culture) must be done using <strong>aseptic technique</strong> (e.g., using a flame-sterilized loop, working near a flame or in a Laminar Air Flow hood) to prevent re-contamination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Preparation of Spawn and Multiplication</h2>

        <h3>What is Spawn?</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Spawn</strong> is the "seed" for mushroom cultivation. It is a substrate (like grain or sawdust) that has been completely colonized by the pure mushroom mycelium.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Instead of trying to grow the mushroom from microscopic spores, farmers use spawn, which is already a vigorous, established network of mycelium. This gives the mushroom a huge head start against any potential contaminants.</p>

        <h3>Preparation of Spawn</h3>
        <p>The most common type is <strong>grain spawn</strong>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select Grains:</strong> Wheat, rye, sorghum (jowar), or millet are commonly used.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Grains:</strong> The grains are washed and boiled in water until they are hydrated (swollen) but not split.</li>
            <li><strong>Dry and Mix:</strong> The grains are drained well. Chalk (calcium carbonate) is often added to balance the pH and prevent grains from sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Bag and Sterilize:</strong> The prepared grains are filled into heat-resistant polypropylene bags or glass bottles, plugged, and then <strong>sterilized in an autoclave</strong> (121°C, 15 psi, for 1-2 hours) to kill all contaminants.</li>
            <li><strong>Inoculation:</strong> Once the sterile grain has cooled, a small piece of the <strong>pure culture</strong> (from the PDA dish) is transferred aseptically into the bag of grain.</li>
            <li><strong>Incubation:</strong> The bags are sealed and left in a dark, clean room for 2-4 weeks. The mycelium will grow out from the agar piece and spread, completely covering all the grains in a white, fluffy mass. This final product is the <strong>spawn</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Multiplication</h3>
        <p>Spawn can be "multiplied" to create more spawn. Instead of using the PDA culture (which is slow), a spawn-maker can simply take a handful of the fully colonized grain spawn and transfer it to a new, sterile bag of grains. [cite_start]This is called a <strong>Grain-to-Grain (G2G) transfer</strong> and is much faster, as the mycelium is already adapted to growing on grain[cite: 429].</p>
