            <h2>Science, Logic, and Reasoning</h2>
            <p>Units 1-4 dealt with <strong>Deductive Logic</strong>, where the conclusion follows from the premises with <em>absolute certainty</em>.</p>
            <p>Science, however, relies primarily on <strong>Inductive Logic</strong>. In induction, the premises (our observations) make the conclusion <em>highly probable</em>, but not certain. Science aims to build the best possible explanation for the evidence we have.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deduction:</strong> "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." (Conclusion is 100% certain).</li>
                <li><strong>Induction (Science):</strong> "Every swan I have ever seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white." (This was believed to be true until black swans were discovered in Australia).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is a Hypothesis?</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. It is a tentative, testable "educated guess" about how or why something happens.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the starting point for all scientific investigation.</li>
                <li>A good hypothesis must be <strong>testable</strong> and <strong>falsifiable</strong> (we must be able to imagine an experiment that could prove it wrong).</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> "My car won't start" (Observation). "The battery is dead" (Hypothesis).</li>

        <section id="topic3">
            <h2>The Scientific Method</h2>
            <p>The scientific method is the process of using hypotheses to understand the world. While shown as a simple list, it is often a complex, cyclical process.</p>

            <h3>The Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>1. Identify the Problem/Observation:</strong> Notice a phenomenon that needs explaining (e.g., "Why are the plants in my garden dying?").</li>
                <li><strong>2. Form a Hypothesis:</strong> Propose a preliminary explanation (e.g., "Hypothesis 1: There is not enough water." or "Hypothesis 2: There is a pest in the soil.").</li>
                <li><strong>3. Deduce Testable Consequences:</strong> Logically deduce what *must* also be true if the hypothesis is true (e.g., "If H1 is true, then giving the plants more water will make them recover.").</li>
                <li><strong>4. Experiment/Test:</strong> Conduct an experiment to test the consequence (e.g., Water one group of plants (the test group) but not another (the control group)).</li>
                <li><strong>5. Analyze and Conclude:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the plants recover, the hypothesis is <strong>confirmed</strong> (not "proven," but strengthened).</li>
                        <li>If the plants still die, the hypothesis is <strong>falsified</strong> (disproven).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>6. Refine and Repeat:</strong> If falsified, go back to Step 2 and form a new hypothesis (e.g., "Let's test Hypothesis 2 about the pests.").</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Criteria for Evaluating Hypotheses</h2>
            <p>Often in science, we have multiple hypotheses that all seem to explain the facts. How do we choose the *best* one? We use a set of criteria:</p>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Criterion</th>
                        <th>Meaning</th>
                        <th>Example</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>1. Explanatory Power</strong></td>
                        <td>How many facts does the hypothesis explain? Does it explain them well?</td>
                        <td>Newton's theory of gravity explained falling apples, the tides, and the orbits of planets. It had huge explanatory power.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>2. Falsifiability/Testability</strong></td>
                        <td>Is there an experiment that *could* prove it wrong? If not, it's not a scientific hypothesis.</td>
                        <td>"The planets are held in their orbits by invisible, undetectable angels." This is unfalsifiable and thus unscientific.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>3. Simplicity (Occam's Razor)</strong></td>
                        <td>"Do not multiply entities beyond necessity." When two theories explain the same facts, the *simpler* one is usually better.</td>
                        <td>The "Sun-centered" model of the solar system was much simpler than the complex "Earth-centered" model.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>4. Predictive Power</strong></td>
                        <td>Does the hypothesis predict *new* facts that we haven't observed yet?</td>
                        <td>Einstein's theory of relativity predicted that light would bend around stars, which was later observed during an eclipse.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>5. Conservatism</strong></td>
                        <td>How well does the hypothesis fit with other, well-established scientific laws?</td>
                        <td>A theory claiming a new plant food works is fine. A theory claiming the plant food works by "magic" would be rejected because it violates the laws of physics.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
