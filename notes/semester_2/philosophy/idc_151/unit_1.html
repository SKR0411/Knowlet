            <h2>What is Environmental Ethics?</h2>
            <p><strong>Environmental Ethics</strong> is a branch of applied philosophy that studies the moral relationship between human beings and the natural environment. It also examines the moral justification for policies aimed at protecting the environment and reversing degradation.</p>
            <p>It moves beyond traditional ethics, which was mostly human-centered (anthropocentric), to ask questions about our obligations to non-human entities.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Central Question:</strong> Do we have moral obligations to animals, plants, species, or entire ecosystems? If so, what is the basis of these obligations?
            </blockquote>
            <p>The course objectives highlight that this field establishes a relationship between humans and the environment, showing our dependence on it.</p>

            <h2>Scope of Environmental Ethics</h2>
            <p>The scope of environmental ethics is vast and addresses many fundamental questions. It's not just about pollution; it's about our core values.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What has moral value?</strong> Does only humanity have intrinsic value (Anthropocentrism)? Do all living beings have value (Biocentrism)? Or do entire ecosystems, including non-living parts, have value (Ecocentrism)? (See Unit 3)</li>
                <li><strong>Animal Rights:</strong> Do animals have rights, or just 'welfare' to be considered? (See Unit 4)</li>
                <li><strong>Future Generations:</strong> Do we have a moral duty to preserve the environment for humans who are not yet born?</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Justice:</strong> Why do environmental problems (like pollution and climate change) disproportionately affect poor communities and marginalized groups?</li>
                <li><strong>Policy and Action:</strong> What kind of environmental policies are morally justifiable? Is it right to use economic costs vs. benefits, or are some things (like a species) priceless?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="topic3">
            <h2>Importance of Environmental Ethics</h2>
            <p>Studying environmental ethics is crucial, especially in the modern era, for several reasons. The course outcome states the goal is to make students aware of these issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Crisis:</strong> We face unprecedented crises like **climate change**, mass extinction, and widespread **pollution**. These are not just scientific or economic problems; they are *ethical* problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenging Assumptions:</strong> It forces us to question our traditional, human-centered worldview and consider our role as part of a larger ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> It provides the moral foundation for **sustainable development**, which is the idea of meeting our needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Responsibility:</strong> It helps us understand our individual and collective **responsibility and obligation** towards the environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Environmental Pollution</h2>
            <p><strong>Pollution</strong> is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Types of Pollution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Caused by industry, vehicle emissions, and burning fossil fuels, leading to health problems and climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Caused by industrial discharge, sewage, and agricultural runoff, harming aquatic life and human health.</li>
                <li><strong>Land Pollution:</strong> Caused by landfills, industrial waste, and pesticides, contaminating soil and groundwater.</li>
                <li><strong>Plastic Pollution:</strong> A visible and harmful problem affecting oceans and wildlife.</li>
            </ul>

            [Image of different types of environmental pollution]

            <h3>Ethical Dimensions of Pollution:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Who creates the most pollution? (Often wealthy nations/corporations). Who suffers the most from it? (Often poor nations/communities). This is the problem of **Environmental Injustice**.</li>
                <li><strong>Rights:</strong> Do people have a right to a clean and healthy environment? If so, pollution violates this right.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:D_ Who should pay for cleaning up pollution? The polluter (Polluter Pays Principle), the consumer, or the government?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> When asked about pollution, don't just list the types. Connect it to the *ethics*. Explain *why* pollution is an ethical issue, using concepts like justice, rights, and responsibility.
