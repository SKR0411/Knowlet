            <h2>Introduction to Meta-Ethics</h2>
            <p>This unit moves from <strong>Normative Ethics</strong> (which asks "What actions are right/wrong?") to <strong>Meta-Ethics</strong>.</p>
            <p>Meta-ethics does not prescribe any moral actions. It asks foundational questions about the nature of morality itself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the meaning of moral terms like 'good', 'right', 'wrong'?</li>
                <li><strong>Ontology:</strong> Do moral truths exist? Are they objective?</li>
                <li><strong>Epistemology:</strong> How do we know what is right and wrong?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The theories in this unit are <strong>Non-Cognitivist</strong> (Emotivism) or <strong>Non-Naturalist</strong> (Moore).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitivism:</strong> Moral statements express beliefs and can be true or false.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Cognitivism:</strong> Moral statements are *not* beliefs and are *not* true or false. They do something else, like express emotions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>G. E. Moore: Indefinibility of 'Good' (Intuitionism)</h2>
            <p>G. E. Moore (1873-1958), in his book <em>Principia Ethica</em>, tackled the first question of meta-ethics: "What is 'good'?"</p>

            <p>His answer was that 'good' is <strong>indefinable</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>'Good' is a simple property:</strong> Moore argued that 'good' is a simple, non-natural property, like the color 'yellow'.</li>
                <li><strong>The Analogy of 'Yellow':</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You cannot *define* 'yellow'. You can't explain it to a blind person.</li>
                        <li>You can't break 'yellow' down into simpler parts. It is just 'yellow'.</li>
                        <li>You can only *show* it by pointing to yellow things (a lemon, a sunflower) and saying "That is yellow."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Similarly, 'good' is a simple concept. You can't define it. You can only point to good *things* (e.g., "honesty is good").</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Ethical Intuitionism</h3>
            <p>If 'good' is indefinable, how do we know what is good?
            <br>
            Moore's answer is <strong>Ethical Intuitionism</strong>. We come to know 'good' (a non-natural property) through a special faculty of <strong>moral intuition</strong>, similar to how we know 'yellow' (a natural property) through our faculty of sight.

        <section id="topic3">
            <h2>G. E. Moore: The Naturalistic Fallacy</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Naturalistic Fallacy</strong> is the central error that Moore claimed almost all other ethical theorists (like Mill) had committed.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The Naturalistic Fallacy is the error of defining 'good' (a non-natural property) in terms of some other <strong>natural property</strong> (like 'pleasure', 'survival', or 'what God wills').
            </blockquote>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1 (Bentham/Mill):</strong> They define "Good" as "pleasure." This is a fallacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2 (Social Darwinists):</strong> They define "Good" as "what is more evolved." This is a fallacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Open Question Argument</h3>
            <p>Moore used this argument to prove *why* it's a fallacy.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take any proposed natural definition: "Good means pleasure."</li>
                <li>Now, ask a question: "I know that X is pleasurable, but <strong>is it good</strong>?"</li>
                <li>This question is "open"—it is an intelligible, meaningful question.</li>
                <li>If "good" *really* meant "pleasure," the question would be silly. It would be like asking "I know X is pleasurable, but is it pleasurable?" (which is a closed, nonsensical question).</li>
                <li>Since the question "Is pleasure good?" is always a meaningful, open question, "good" and "pleasure" cannot mean the same thing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Therefore, any attempt to define 'good' in terms of something else will always fail the Open Question Argument. 'Good' is just 'good', and it is indefinable.</p>

            <h2>Ayer and Stevenson: Emotivism</h2>
            <p>Emotivism is a <strong>Non-Cognitivist</strong> meta-ethical theory. It agrees with Moore that 'good' can't be defined, but for a very different reason. It argues that moral statements aren't just indefinable—they are <strong>cognitively meaningless</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>A. J. Ayer: The "Boo/Hurrah" Theory</h3>
            <p>A. J. Ayer (1910-1989) was a <strong>Logical Positivist</strong>. He believed that for a statement to be meaningful, it must be one of two things:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Analytic:</strong> True by definition (e.g., "All bachelors are unmarried").</li>
                    <li><strong>Synthetic:</strong> Verifiable through sense-experience (e.g., "There is a chair in this room").</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Ayer looked at moral statements like "Stealing is wrong."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's not analytic (it's not true by definition).</li>
                <li>It's not synthetic (you can't "see" or "touch" the "wrongness" of stealing).</li>
                <li>Therefore, moral statements are <strong>cognitively meaningless</strong>. They are not propositions that can be true or false.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>So, what are we doing when we say "Stealing is wrong"?</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Ayer's Answer:</strong> We are simply <strong>expressing our emotion</strong> (evincing) and trying to arouse that emotion in others.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>"Stealing is wrong!" just means "Stealing... <strong>BOO!</strong>"</li>
                <li>"Honesty is good!" just means "Honesty... <strong>HURRAH!</strong>"</li>
                <li>This is why Emotivism is often called the "Boo/Hurrah Theory."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>C. L. Stevenson: Refined Emotivism</h3>
            <p>C. L. Stevenson (1908-1979) agreed with Ayer but thought his model was too simple. Stevenson's Emotivism has two components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Expressive Component:</strong> Like Ayer, moral statements express the speaker's feelings. "This is good" = "I approve of this."</li>
                <li><strong>Persuasive (Dynamic) Component:</strong> This is the new part. Moral statements are also used to <strong>influence or persuade</strong> the listener. "This is good" also means "...<strong>and you should approve of it too!</strong>"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For Stevenson, moral disagreements are not disagreements about *facts* (like in science), but disagreements in *attitude*. The purpose of moral argument is to change the other person's attitude, not to prove them factually wrong.</p>
