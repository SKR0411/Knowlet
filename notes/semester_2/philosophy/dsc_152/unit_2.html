            <h2>Teleological Ethics: Hedonism and its Types</h2>
            <p><strong>Teleological Ethics</strong> (or Consequentialism) comes from the Greek word <em>telos</em>, meaning "end," "goal," or "purpose."</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Principle:</strong> The morality of an action is determined <em>solely</em> by its <strong>consequences</strong>. A right action is one that produces the best overall result.
            </blockquote>
            <p>The main question for a teleologist is: "What is the 'good' that we are trying to maximize?"</p>

            <h3>Hedonism</h3>
            <p><strong>Hedonism</strong> (from Greek <em>hēdonē</em>, "pleasure") is the teleological theory that answers: "The 'good' is <strong>pleasure</strong>, and the 'bad' is <strong>pain</strong>."</p>
            <p>A moral action is one that maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Hedonism:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Psychological Hedonism (Descriptive):</strong> This is a theory of human psychology. It claims that humans, as a matter of fact, are *always* motivated by the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Hedonism (Prescriptive):</strong> This is a normative theory. It claims that humans <em>should</em> seek pleasure, as pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Egoistic Hedonism:</strong> One should seek to maximize *one's own* pleasure. (e.g., Cārvāka in Indian ethics).</li>
                        <li><strong>Universalistic Hedonism:</strong> One should seek to maximize the pleasure of *all* affected. This is <strong>Utilitarianism</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Utilitarianism (Bentham and Mill)</h2>
            <p>Utilitarianism is the most prominent form of teleological ethics. Its core idea is the <strong>"Principle of Utility"</strong> or the <strong>"Greatest Happiness Principle."</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Principle of Utility:</strong> An action is right if it produces the greatest amount of good (happiness/pleasure) for the greatest number of people.
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>1. Jeremy Bentham: Quantitative Utilitarianism</h3>
            <p>Bentham (1748-1832) was the founder of modern utilitarianism. He argued for a <strong>quantitative</strong> approach to pleasure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Idea:</strong> All pleasures are of the same kind. They only differ in <em>quantity</em>. "Pushpin (a simple game) is as good as poetry" if it produces the same amount of pleasure.</li>
                <li><strong>Hedonic Calculus:</strong> To measure the quantity of pleasure, Bentham proposed 7 criteria:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> How strong is the pleasure?</li>
                        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> How long will it last?</li>
                        <li><strong>Certainty:</strong> How likely is it to occur?</li>
                        <li><strong>Propinquity (or Remoteness):</strong> How soon will it occur?</li>
                        <li><strong>Fecundity:</strong> Will it lead to *more* pleasures?</li>
                        <li><strong>Purity:</strong> How free from pain is it?</li>
                        <li><strong>Extent:</strong> How many people will it affect?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. John Stuart Mill: Qualitative Utilitarianism</h3>
            <p>Mill (1806-1873) was Bentham's student but refined (and changed) the theory. He argued for a <strong>qualitative</strong> approach.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Some pleasures are inherently <em>better</em> than others. Pleasures of the intellect, morality, and art (<strong>higher pleasures</strong>) are superior to mere bodily sensations (<strong>lower pleasures</strong>).</li>
                <li><strong>Famous Quote:</strong> "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."</li>
                <li>Mill argued that anyone who has experienced both types of pleasure will always prefer the higher one.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip: Bentham vs. Mill is a classic question.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bentham:</strong> Quantitative. All pleasure is equal. "Pushpin is as good as poetry." Uses Hedonic Calculus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mill:</strong> Qualitative. Some pleasures are better. "Better to be Socrates dissatisfied."</li>

            <h2>Virtue Ethics: Aristotle - Nature and Kinds of Virtue</h2>
            <p>Virtue ethics shifts the focus of ethics entirely. Instead of asking "What is the right action?" (like Utilitarianism or Deontology), it asks: <strong>"What is a good person?"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proponent:</strong> <strong>Aristotle</strong> (384–322 BC) in his work <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal of Life:</strong> The ultimate end for humans is <strong>Eudaimonia</strong>, a Greek word meaning "flourishing," "well-being," or "a life well-lived." It is not just a fleeting feeling of happiness, but a state of being.</li>
                <li><strong>How to achieve Eudaimonia:</strong> By living a life of <strong>Virtue</strong> (<em>Arete</em>).</li>
                <li><strong>Nature of Virtue:</strong> For Aristotle, a virtue is a state of character that is the "mean" between two extremes. It is a <em>disposition</em> to act in the right way, for the right reason, at the right time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Kinds of Virtue (Aristotle):</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Intellectual Virtues:</strong> Excellences of the mind. These are learned through <strong>teaching</strong> and experience.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examples: <em>Sophia</em> (theoretical wisdom), <em>Phronesis</em> (practical wisdom/prudence).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Moral Virtues:</strong> Excellences of character. These are learned through <strong>habit and practice</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are not born brave or honest; we <em>become</em> brave by repeatedly *doing* brave acts.</li>
                        <li>Examples: Courage, Temperance, Generosity, Justice.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="topic4">
            <h2>Virtue Ethics: Aristotle - Theory of Golden Mean</h2>
            <p>This is the core of Aristotle's moral ethics. The "Golden Mean" is the idea that every moral virtue is a midpoint (or "mean") between two corresponding vices (extremes).</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>The Doctrine of the Mean:</strong> A moral virtue is a <strong>state of balance</strong> between a vice of <strong>deficiency</strong> (too little) and a vice of <strong>excess</strong> (too much).
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The vice of deficiency is <strong>Cowardice</strong> (you have too little fear).</li>
                    <li>The vice of excess is <strong>Rashness</strong> (you have too much fearlessness).</li>
                    <li>The virtue or "Golden Mean" is <strong>Courage</strong> (you have the *right amount* of fear, at the right time).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here are some common examples:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>

            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> The mean is <strong>not</strong> a mathematical average. It is "relative to us." The right amount of food (temperance) for a professional athlete is different from the right amount for a small child. "Practical wisdom" (<em>Phronesis</em>) is the intellectual virtue we use to find the mean in any given situation.
