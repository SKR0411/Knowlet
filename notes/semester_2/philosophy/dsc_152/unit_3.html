            <h2>Deontological Ethics: Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Deontological Ethics</strong> comes from the Greek word <em>deon</em>, meaning "duty."</p>
            <p>This is a non-consequentialist theory. It stands in direct opposition to Utilitarianism.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Principle:</strong> The morality of an action is based on the <strong>nature of the action itself</strong> (whether it follows a rule or "duty"), not on its consequences.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain actions are <strong>intrinsically right or wrong</strong>, regardless of the outcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A deontologist would argue that lying is *always* wrong, even if it produces a good result (like saving someone's feelings).</li>
                <li>The main proponent of this theory is <strong>Immanuel Kant</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="topic2">
            <h2>Kant: Good Will</h2>
            <p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) begins his ethics by looking for something that is <strong>unconditionally good</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>He rejects happiness, intelligence, and courage as unconditionally good, because they can all be used for evil purposes (e.g., a happy, intelligent, courageous bank robber).</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Kant's Famous Opening:</strong> "Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a <strong>good will</strong>."
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Good Will</strong> is the "will to do good." It is the <strong>motive</strong> or <strong>intention</strong> to do the right thing simply *because* it is the right thing.</li>
                <li>It "shines by its own light." Even if a good will fails to achieve its goals (e.g., you try to save a drowning person but fail), it is still good in itself.</li>
                <li>For Kant, the <strong>consequences are morally irrelevant</strong>. Only the motive matters.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section id="topic3">
            <h2>Kant: Categorical Imperative</h2>
            <p>If the Good Will is the *motive*, what is the *rule* it follows? Kant says the Good Will follows the <strong>Categorical Imperative</strong>. This is the supreme principle of morality.</p>

            <h3>Hypothetical vs. Categorical Imperatives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hypothetical Imperative:</strong> A command that is conditional. It's an "if-then" statement.
                    <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "<strong>If</strong> you want to pass the exam, <strong>then</strong> you must study." (This doesn't apply to you if you don't care about the exam).</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Categorical Imperative:</strong> An <strong>unconditional</strong> command. It applies to all rational beings, at all times, in all situations. It is a "must-do," period.
                    <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "You <strong>must not</strong> lie." (It doesn't say "if you don't want to get caught...").</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Formulations of the Categorical Imperative</h3>
            <p>Kant gives several formulations. The two most famous are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Formula of Universal Law:</strong>
                    <blockquote>"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."</blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>In simple terms:</strong> "Before you act, ask what would happen if *everyone* acted this way?" If it leads to a contradiction, the act is immoral.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kant's Example: The Lying Promise.</strong> A man needs money. Can he promise to pay it back, even though he knows he can't?
                            <ul><li><em>Maxim:</em> "When in need, I will make a false promise to get money."</li>
                                <li><em>Universalize:</em> "Everyone in need will make false promises."</li>
                                <li><em>Contradiction:</em> If everyone did this, the very institution of "promising" would collapse. No one would believe promises anymore. Therefore, the act is immoral.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Formula of Humanity (or End-in-Itself):</strong>
                    <blockquote>"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a <strong>means</strong>, but always at the same time as an <strong>end</strong>."</blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>In simple terms:</strong> "Don't use people." All rational beings have intrinsic worth and dignity.</li>
                        <li>Using someone "merely as a means" is to exploit or manipulate them (e.g., the lying promise uses the lender merely as a means to get money).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section id="topic4">
            <h2>Kant: Duty for Duty's sake</h2>
            <p>This concept ties back to the Good Will. For an action to have <strong>moral worth</strong>, it must be done <em>from</em> duty, not just <em>in accordance with</em> duty.</p>
            
            <p>Kant gives the example of a <strong>shopkeeper</strong> who is honest with his customers.</p>
            <div class="add-horizontal-scroll">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Motive</th>
                        <th>Kant's Judgement</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>He is honest because he fears getting caught (bad reputation, legal trouble).</td>
                        <td><strong>No Moral Worth.</strong> This is action <em>in accordance with</em> duty, but done from self-interest.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>He is honest because he is naturally sympathetic and likes his customers.</td>
                        <td><strong>No Moral Worth.</strong> This is also <em>in accordance with</em> duty, but done from inclination (emotion), not reason.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>He is honest because he is a cold-hearted person who hates his customers, but he knows that honesty is the <strong>right thing to do</strong>.</td>
                        <td><strong>This has Moral Worth.</strong> The action is done <em>from</em> duty, for duty's sake alone.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </div>
            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Kant's ethics is based on <strong>reason</strong>, not emotion or consequence. The only moral motive is the rational respect for the moral law (the Categorical Imperative).

        <section id="topic5">
            <h2>W. D. Ross: Deontological Pluralism</h2>
            <p>W. D. Ross (1877-1971) was a deontologist who felt Kant was too absolute. Kant's theory allows for *no exceptions* (e.g., you can't lie even to save a life). Ross found this problematic.</p>

            <h3>Deontological Pluralism</h3>
            <p>Ross argues that there is not just *one* supreme moral principle (like the Categorical Imperative), but a *plurality* (many) of them. He calls these <strong>Prima Facie Duties</strong>.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Prima Facie Duty:</strong> An "at first glance" duty. It is a moral obligation that is binding, *unless* it conflicts with a stronger moral obligation in a particular situation.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Ross's (non-exhaustive) list of Prima Facie Duties:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Fidelity:</strong> The duty to keep promises (and be truthful).</li>
                <li><strong>Reparation:</strong> The duty to make amends for a wrong we have done.</li>
                <li><strong>Gratitude:</strong> The duty to return favors.</li>
                <li><strong>Justice:</strong> The duty to distribute benefits and burdens fairly.</li>
                <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> The duty to do good to others.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-maleficence:</strong> The duty to *not* harm others (often seen as stronger than beneficence).</li>
                <li><strong>Self-improvement:</strong> The duty to improve our own character and intellect.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Resolving Conflict</h3>
            <p>For Ross, moral dilemmas happen when these Prima Facie duties conflict.
            <br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> The classic "Inquiring Murderer." A murderer asks you where your friend is.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kant:</strong> You must not lie. Your duty is absolute.</li>
                <li><strong>Ross:</strong> You have a conflict between two Prima Facie duties:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Duty of Fidelity (to tell the truth).</li>
                        <li>Duty of Non-maleficence (to not harm your friend).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case, Ross says we must use our <strong>moral intuition</strong> to determine our <strong>Actual Duty</strong>. It is "self-evident" that the duty of Non-maleficence is stronger, and therefore our *actual* duty in this situation is to lie.</p>
