            <h2>Swami Vivekananda: Practical Vedānta</h2>
            <p>Swami Vivekananda sought to transform the abstract, metaphysical philosophy of Advaita Vedānta into a practical, social, and ethical guide for modern life.</p>

            <h3>Core Idea: Practical Vedānta</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metaphysical Basis:</strong> Advaita Vedānta, which states that all reality is one (<strong>Brahman</strong>) and the individual soul (<strong>Ātman</strong>) is identical to Brahman ("<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>" - Thou Art That).</li>
                <li><strong>The Ethical Leap:</strong> Vivekananda asked: If all is one, if every being is divine, how can we treat anyone as low, poor, or different?</li>
                <li><strong>Core Principle:</strong> "Service to Man is Service to God." The best way to worship God (Brahman) is to serve the divine spark (Ātman) present in all living beings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Ethical Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daridra Nārāyaṇa:</strong> "God in the poor." Vivekananda saw God in the poor, the ignorant, and the suffering. He believed that social service (helping the poor, education, healthcare) was not mere charity, but an act of <strong>worship</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics of Strength:</strong> He believed that weakness was the only sin. Morality, for him, was rooted in strength—the strength that comes from realizing the divine, fearless Ātman within. "Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached."</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Religion:</strong> He preached the harmony of all religions, stating that all religions are different paths to the same goal (the realization of the divine). This promotes an ethic of tolerance and mutual respect.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Vivekananda's Practical Vedānta shifts the focus of ethics from individual liberation (Mokṣa) through solitary meditation to <strong>collective upliftment and social service</strong> as the primary spiritual and ethical path.

            <h2>M. K. Gandhi: Ahiṃsā and Satyāgraha</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi's ethics are centered on the two inseparable principles of Truth (Satya) and Non-violence (Ahiṃsā).</p>

            <h3>1. Satya (Truth) and Ahiṃsā (Non-violence)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Satya (Truth):</strong> For Gandhi, Truth is the ultimate goal. It is not just "telling the truth" but the ultimate, absolute reality. He famously stated, <strong>"Truth is God."</strong> This is the <strong>End</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Ahiṃsā (Non-violence):</strong> This is the <strong>Means</strong> to realize Truth. Ahiṃsā is not just "not killing" (a negative concept). It is a positive, active force of <strong>love, compassion, and self-suffering</strong>. It means refraining from harm in thought, word, and deed, even towards one's opponent.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>The Inseparable Link:</strong> Gandhi believed the means and the end are inseparable. A "good" end (like Truth, or India's independence) cannot be achieved through "bad" means (like violence). Only a non-violent (Ahiṃsā) path can lead to Truth (Satya).
            </div>

            <h3>2. Satyāgraha (Truth-Force / Soul-Force)</h3>
            <p>Satyāgraha was Gandhi's practical <em>method</em> of applying Ahiṃsā to social and political conflicts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> It literally means "holding firmly to Truth." It is an active, non-violent resistance against injustice.</li>
                <li><strong>It is NOT Passive Resistance:</strong> Passive resistance can be a tool of the weak and may hide anger. Satyāgraha is a weapon of the strong, based on moral courage and love for the opponent.</li>
                <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> The goal is <em>not</em> to defeat or humiliate the opponent, but to <strong>convert</strong> them. By willingly accepting suffering (e.g., going to jail, being beaten) without retaliating, the Satyāgrahi "opens the opponent's heart" to the truth of the injustice.</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Civil disobedience (breaking unjust laws), non-cooperation, strikes, fasting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>R. N. Tagore: Ethics of Nature and Humanism</h2>
            <p>Rabindranath Tagore's ethics are less of a formal system and more of a poetic and philosophical vision for humanity. His ethic is a "Religion of Man" rooted in humanism and harmony.</p>

            <h3>1. Humanism (Religion of Man)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tagore's ethics are a form of <strong>spiritual humanism</strong>. He believed in the "Surplus in Man"—the creative, artistic, and spiritual part of humanity that goes beyond mere biological survival.</li>
                <li>This "Surplus" is the divine (God) within humanity.</li>
                <li>Ethical life, therefore, is not about following rigid rules, but about the <strong>creative expression</strong> of this inner divinity through love, art, and service to fellow humans.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Ethics of Nature and Harmony</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harmony with Nature:</strong>  Tagore was a strong critic of blind industrialization and materialism, which he saw as disconnecting humans from nature. He believed that a moral life required living in <strong>harmony with the natural world</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>His founding of <strong>Visva-Bharati</strong> (his university) in a natural setting (Shantiniketan) was a testament to this, emphasizing education in "the lap of nature."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Harmony with Humanity (Internationalism):</strong> Tagore was a fierce critic of narrow, aggressive nationalism. He believed that nationalism was a "great menace" that led to conflict and dehumanization.
                    <ul>
                        <li>His humanistic ethic was <strong>internationalist</strong>, preaching the unity of all mankind and the need for harmony between different cultures.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Tagore's Key Ethic:</strong> The highest good is <strong>Harmony</strong>.
                <br>
                1. <strong>Internal Harmony:</strong> Between our animal-self and our spiritual-self (the "Surplus").
                <br>
                2. <strong>Social Harmony:</strong> Between all humans (Internationalism over Nationalism).
                <br>
                3. <strong>Natural Harmony:</strong> Between humanity and the environment.
