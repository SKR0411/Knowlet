            <h2>Śreyas, Preyas, and Puruṣārthas</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>This section explains the fundamental goals that guide human action in Indian ethics[cite: 121].</p>

            <h3>1. Śreyas vs. Preyas</h3>
            <p>This distinction, famously from the <strong>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</strong>, is between two paths in life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preyas (The Pleasant):</strong> This is the path of immediate pleasure, sensory gratification, and material gain. It is what is immediately <em>attractive</em> (e.g., eating junk food, seeking fame).</li>
                <li><strong>Śreyas (The Good):</strong> This is the path of what is ultimately <em>beneficial</em>. It often involves discipline, short-term discomfort, and spiritual seeking, but leads to lasting good and liberation (e.g., eating healthy, seeking truth).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> The Upaniṣad states that the wise person (<em>dhīra</em>) analyzes both and chooses <strong>Śreyas</strong> over <strong>Preyas</strong>. The ignorant person chooses Preyas, becomes attached, and ultimately suffers.
            </div>

            <h3>2. Puruṣārthas (The Four Goals of Human Life)</h3>
            <p>The Puruṣārthas are a comprehensive framework for a fulfilling human life, integrating both material and spiritual needs. They are the four legitimate goals that any person can pursue.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dharma (Righteousness / Duty):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ethical and moral foundation of life. It is the principle of righteousness that guides the pursuit of the other two goals.</li>
                        <li>It is the "container" that holds Artha and Kāma.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Artha (Wealth / Prosperity):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The pursuit of material wealth, economic security, and worldly success.</li>
                        <li>It is considered a valid and necessary goal, *as long as it is pursued within the bounds of Dharma* (e.g., one should not steal or cheat to get rich).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Kāma (Desire / Pleasure):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The pursuit of sensory pleasure, aesthetic enjoyment, desire, and emotional fulfillment.</li>
                        <li>Like Artha, it is a legitimate goal when guided by Dharma (e.g., enjoying family life and art, not harmful indulgence).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mokṣa (Liberation / Spiritual Freedom):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ultimate goal of life (<em>Parama-Puruṣārtha</em>).</li>
                        <li>It is the state of complete freedom from the cycle of birth and death (Saṃsāra) and the realization of one's true Self (Ātman).</li>
                        <li>The first three goals (Dharma, Artha, Kāma) prepare an individual for this final pursuit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="topic2">
            <h2>Mokṣa and Morality</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>This explores the relationship between the ultimate goal (Mokṣa) and the path to it (morality)[cite: 121].</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mokṣa as the End:</strong> As seen in the Puruṣārthas, Mokṣa is the highest end. It is a state of being, not a place (like heaven). It is the realization of ultimate truth and freedom from all suffering and limitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Morality as the Means:</strong> Morality (i.e., living a life of Dharma) is the <strong>indispensable means</strong> (<em>sādhana</em>) to achieve the end (<em>sādhya</em>) of Mokṣa.</li>
                <li><strong>How morality leads to Mokṣa:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Living an ethical life (practicing truth, non-violence, compassion, etc.) leads to <strong>Citta-śuddhi</strong> (purification of the mind).</li>
                        <li>A pure, calm, and disciplined mind is the only instrument capable of understanding the subtle truths of the Upaniṣads and achieving the self-realization that <em>is</em> Mokṣa.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Relationship:</strong> You cannot achieve spiritual liberation (Mokṣa) without a strong foundation of moral purity (Dharma). Morality is the path; liberation is the destination.
            </div>

        <section id="topic3">
            <h2>Concept of Dharma: Swadharma and Varṇāśramadharma</h2>
            <p>Dharma is the most central concept in Indian ethics. [cite_start]It literally means "that which upholds" or "sustains"[cite: 122]. It refers to cosmic law, social duty, moral virtue, and one's personal path.</p>

            <h3>1. Varṇāśramadharma (Specific Duties)</h3>
            <p>This is the classical framework of specific duties based on one's social role and stage of life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Varṇa Dharma (Duties of Social Function):</strong> Duties based on one's innate temperament and function in society.
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Brāhmaṇa:</strong> Priests, teachers, scholars (duty of knowledge and teaching).</li>
                        <li><strong>Kṣatriya:</strong> Warriors, rulers, administrators (duty of protection and governance).</li>
                        <li><strong>Vaiśya:</strong> Merchants, farmers, artisans (duty of commerce and generating wealth).</li>
                        <li><strong>Śūdra:</strong> Laborers, service providers (duty of service and support).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Āśrama Dharma (Duties of Life-Stage):</strong> Duties that change as one progresses through life.
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Brahmacharya:</strong> The Student Stage (celibacy, discipline, acquiring knowledge).</li>
                        <li><strong>Gṛhastha:</strong> The Householder Stage (marriage, family, pursuing Artha and Kāma, supporting other stages).</li>
                        <li><strong>Vānaprastha:</strong> The Forest-dweller Stage (retirement from worldly duties, more spiritual focus).</li>
                        <li><strong>Sannyāsa:</strong> The Renunciate Stage (complete detachment from the world to seek Mokṣa).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Swadharma (One's "Own" Duty)</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Swadharma</strong> is one's personal, unique duty, determined by their specific Varṇa, Āśrama, and individual nature (<em>svabhāva</em>).
            </blockquote>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gītā (which we'll see next) places immense importance on Swadharma. Lord Krishna's main argument to Arjuna is that he must follow his Swadharma as a Kṣatriya, which is to fight for righteousness.</p>
            <p><em>"Śhreyān swa-dharmo viguṇaḥ para-dharmāt sv-anuṣhṭhitāt"</em> - Bhagavad Gītā 3.35</p>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> "It is far better to perform one's own duty (Swadharma), even imperfectly, than to perform another's duty perfectly."</p>
            <p>This concept emphasizes authenticity and that the moral path is not "one size fits all."</p>

        <section id="topic4">
            <h2>Ethics of Bhagavad Gīta: Niṣkāma Karma</h2>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gītā presents a profound ethical teaching in a moment of crisis. [cite_start]Its central message is <strong>Niṣkāma Karma</strong>, or the "path of selfless action"[cite: 123].</p>

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>Arjuna, a Kṣatriya warrior, faces a moral dilemma. His Swadharma (duty as a warrior) demands he fight a righteous war, but this requires him to kill his own family members, teachers, and friends. He collapses in despair.</p>

            <h3>The Solution: Niṣkāma Karma (Action without Desire)</h3>
            <p>Lord Krishna's answer is the core of Gītā's ethics. He teaches Arjuna how to act in the world without being bound by the (karmic) consequences of his actions.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <em>"Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣhu kadāchana"</em> - Bhagavad Gītā 2.47
                <br>
                <strong>Meaning:</strong> "You have a right to the <strong>action</strong> alone, never to its <strong>fruits</strong> (results)."
            </blockquote>

            <p>The principles of Niṣkāma Karma are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Perform Your Duty (Swadharma):</strong> You must act. Inaction is not an option. Arjuna must fight because it is his duty.</li>
                <li><strong>Renounce Attachment to the Fruits:</strong> Act with all your skill and dedication, but do not be motivated by the <em>result</em> (e.g., victory, fame, wealth).</li>
                <li><strong>Act with Equanimity (Samatvam):</strong> Be indifferent to success and failure, pleasure and pain, gain and loss. This mental stability is "Yoga."</li>
                <li><strong>Offer Your Actions to God:</strong> Perform your duty as an offering to the divine, without any selfish motive.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Niṣkāma Karma is <strong>NOT</strong> "inaction." It is also <strong>NOT</strong> "acting without any intention." It is "acting with full intention and effort, but without selfish attachment to the personal outcome." It is <strong>renunciation *in* action</strong>, not renunciation *of* action.
