            <h2>Ethics: Meaning, Nature, and Scope (Indian Perspective)</h2>
            <p>This section introduces the foundational concepts of ethics as understood in the Indian philosophical tradition.</p>

            <h3>1. Meaning of Indian Ethics</h3>
            <p>The English word 'Ethics' comes from the Greek 'ethos', meaning "custom" or "character." The closest Sanskrit equivalent is <strong>Nītiśāstra</strong> (science of conduct) or, more broadly, <strong>Dharma</strong>.</p>
            <p>Unlike Western ethics, which often focuses on analyzing moral actions in a secular framework, Indian ethics is deeply intertwined with a spiritual worldview. It is not just a study of "what is right" but a practical guide on "how to live" a life that leads to the ultimate goal of
                liberation (<strong>Mokṣa</strong>).</p>

            <h3>2. Nature of Indian Ethics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spiritual and Metaphysical:</strong> Indian ethics is rooted in the metaphysical beliefs of various schools (e.g., the concept of Ātman, Brahman, Karma, Saṃsāra). The goal of life is not just a good society but spiritual realization.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical:</strong> It is not merely a theoretical subject. It is a <em>'how-to'</em> guide for life, aimed at transforming one's character and consciousness.</li>
                <li><strong>Holistic:</strong> It covers every aspect of human life, from individual duties (personal hygiene, study) to social obligations (family, society) and spiritual aspirations.</li>
                <li><strong>Authoritative:</strong> Traditionally, its authority comes from sacred texts (like the Vedas, Upaniṣads, Gītā) and the teachings of enlightened sages (Rishis).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Scope of Indian Ethics</h3>
            <p>The scope of Indian ethics is vast, encompassing all of life's activities. It provides a framework for integrating human goals. Key components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purushārthas:</strong> The four goals of human life (Dharma, Artha, Kāma, Mokṣa).</li>
                <li><strong>Varṇāśramadharma:</strong> Duties based on one's stage in life (Āśrama) and social function (Varṇa).</li>
                <li><strong>Sādhāraṇa Dharma:</strong> Universal virtues applicable to all people (e.g., truth, non-violence, honesty).</li>
                <li><strong>Law of Karma:</strong> The moral law of cause and effect that governs the universe.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A common question is to contrast Indian and Western ethics. Remember:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Indian Ethics:</strong> Primarily spiritual, practical, aims at <em>Mokṣa</em> (liberation), rooted in scriptures, and holistic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Western Ethics:</strong> Often secular, analytical, aims at a <em>good life or society</em>, rooted in reason, and often focuses on specific domains (like normative, meta-, or applied ethics).</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="topic2">
            <h2>Vedic Ethics: Ṛta (Cosmic Order)</h2>
            <p>Ṛta (or Ritam) is one of the earliest and most important concepts in Vedic ethics.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Ṛta</strong> is the "Cosmic Order" or "Universal Law." It is the principle of truth, harmony, and justice that governs the entire universe.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>It controls the movement of the stars and planets, the changing of the seasons, the rising and setting of the sun, and the laws of nature.</li>
                <li>It also governs the actions of gods and human beings.</li>
                <li>Living a moral life, for the Vedic people, meant living in <strong>accordance with Ṛta</strong>.</li>
                <li>Actions that went against this harmony were called <strong>Anṛta</strong> (disorder, untruth) and were considered immoral or sinful.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Ṛta is an <strong>impersonal and automatic</strong> law. It's not a command from a god. Even the gods (like Varuna, the guardian of Ṛta) are subject to it. This concept later evolves into the more complex ideas of <strong>Dharma</strong> and <strong>Karma</strong>.

        <section id="topic3">
            <h2>Vedic Ethics: Ṛṇa (Debts)</h2>
            <p>The concept of Ṛṇa establishes a framework of obligations that every individual is born with. Morality, in this view, is about discharging these fundamental debts.</p>
            <p>According to the texts, a human is born with three primary debts (<strong>Tri-Ṛṇa</strong>):</p>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>The Debt (Ṛṇa)</th>
                        <th>To Whom?</th>
                        <th>How is it Repaid?</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>1. Deva Ṛṇa</strong> (Debt to the Gods)</td>
                        <td>To the gods/divine forces who provide air, water, light, and rain.</td>
                        <td>Through <strong>Yajña</strong> (sacrifices, rituals, and offerings). This maintains the cosmic balance and shows gratitude.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>2. Ṛṣi Ṛṇa</strong> (Debt to the Sages)</td>
                        <td>To the great sages (Rishis) who discovered knowledge and gave us the scriptures (Vedas).</td>
                        <td>Through <strong>Brahmacharya</strong> (study of scriptures, acquiring knowledge) and then preserving and passing on this knowledge to the next generation.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>3. Pitṛ Ṛṇa</strong> (Debt to the Ancestors)</td>
                        <td>To our forefathers, who gave us our life and lineage.</td>
                        <td>Through <strong>Prajā</strong> (procreating and raising children), especially a son who can perform the necessary funeral rites (śrāddha) to ensure the ancestors' well-being.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>By fulfilling these three Ṛṇas, an individual becomes a responsible member of the cosmic and social order and is then free to pursue spiritual liberation (Mokṣa).</p>

        <section id="topic4">
            <h2>Vedic Ethics: Law of Karma</h2>
            <p>The Law of Karma is the foundational moral law of the universe in Indian thought. It is the logical successor to the concept of Ṛta.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Karma</strong> literally means "action." The Law of Karma is the universal principle of cause and effect, where every moral or immoral action (cause) inevitably leads to a corresponding consequence (effect, or <em>phala</em>).
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>Key Features of the Law of Karma:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It is a Law of Justice:</strong> "As you sow, so shall you reap." Good actions (Puṇya) lead to happiness and a favorable rebirth, while bad actions (Pāpa) lead to suffering and an unfavorable rebirth.</li>
                <li><strong>It is Not Fatalism:</strong> It is not "fate." Fate implies a pre-determined destiny. Karma is the opposite; it implies that <strong>you create your own destiny</strong> through your present actions. It empowers the individual.</li>
                <li><strong>It explains Saṃsāra:</strong> The law of Karma is intrinsically linked to <strong>Saṃsāra</strong> (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth). The consequences of one's actions may not all manifest in this life, thus requiring future lives to be experienced.</li>
                <li><strong>The Goal is Liberation:</strong> The ultimate goal (Mokṣa) is to be liberated <em>from</em> this cycle of Karma and Saṃsāra.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="types-of-karma">Types of Karma (for Exam)</h3>
            <p>For a deeper understanding, Karma is often classified into three types. This is a very common exam topic.</p>

                        <td>The <strong>arrow that has already been shot</strong> from the bow. You cannot recall it. You must experience its impact.</td>

                <strong>How to explain Karma in an exam:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with the simple definition: "Law of moral cause and effect."</li>
                    <li>Explain its link to Saṃsāra (rebirth) and how it provides justice.</li>
                    <li>Distinguish it from fatalism (fate). Karma is about self-creation and responsibility.</li>
                    <li>Use the three types (Sañchita, Prārabdha, Kriyamāṇa) to show how it works. The archer analogy is perfect for this.</li>
