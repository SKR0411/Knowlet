        <h2 id="topic1">Basic Concepts and Definitions</h2>
        <p>This section covers the fundamental vocabulary of ecology.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ecology:</strong> The scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment (both living/biotic and non-living/abiotic). </li>
            <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> A heterogeneous area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems (e.g., a mosaic of forests, fields, and ponds). </li>
            <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> The natural environment or "address" where an organism or population lives, characterized by its physical and chemical features. </li>
            <li><strong>Ecozones (or Biogeographic Realms):</strong> Large areas of the Earth's surface where organisms have evolved in relative isolation over long periods, separated by geographic barriers (e.g., deserts, oceans).</li>
            <li><strong>Biosphere:</strong> The global sum of all ecosystems; the zone of life on Earth, including parts of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. </li>
            <li><strong>Ecosystems:</strong> A community of living organisms (biotic) interacting with their non-living (abiotic) physical environment as a single functional unit. </li>
            <li><strong>Autecology:</strong> The study of the ecology of a <strong>single species</strong>, focusing on its interactions with its environment (also called species ecology). </li>
            <li><strong>Synecology:</strong> The study of the ecology of a <strong>group of species</strong> that form a community, focusing on their interactions (also called community ecology). </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Major Terrestrial Biomes</h2>
        <p><strong>Biomes</strong> are very large ecological areas on the Earth's surface, defined by the dominant plant life and a shared climate.  Climate, particularly <strong>temperature and precipitation</strong>, is the main factor determining a biome.</p>

        <h2 id="topic3">Ecological Amplitude</h2>
        <p><strong>Ecological Amplitude</strong> refers to the <strong>range of tolerance</strong> an organism or species has for a specific environmental factor (e.g., temperature, pH, salinity). </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Species with a <strong>wide ecological amplitude</strong> are generalists and can survive in a broad range of conditions. They are often widely distributed. (e.g., a rat).</li>
            <li>Species with a <strong>narrow ecological amplitude</strong> are specialists and can only survive in very specific conditions. They are often rare or restricted in their distribution. (e.g., a panda).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Laws of Limiting Factors</h2>
        <p>These two laws explain how environmental factors control the growth and distribution of organisms.</p>
        
        <h3>Liebig's Law of the Minimum (1840) </h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The growth of a plant is dependent on the amount of foodstuff which is presented to it in <strong>minimum quantity</strong>."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Imagine a wooden barrel with staves of different lengths. The barrel can only hold water up to the height of the <strong>shortest stave</strong>.
        <br>
        <strong>Application:</strong> An organism's growth is not controlled by the total amount of all nutrients, but by the <strong>one nutrient that is scarcest</strong> (the "limiting factor"). For example, plant growth in a lake is often limited by phosphorus, even if nitrogen and carbon are abundant. Adding more nitrogen won't help; only adding phosphorus will increase growth.</p>

        <h3>Shelford's Law of Tolerance (1913) </h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"An organism's success is determined by a range of environmental conditions, with a <strong>minimum, maximum, and optimum</strong> value for each factor."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> This law expands on Liebig's Law. It states that it's not just "too little" of a factor that limits an organism, but also <strong>"too much"</strong>.
        <br>
        <strong>Application:</strong> For any factor (like temperature), an organism has:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimum Range:</strong> The ideal level where it thrives.</li>
            <li><strong>Zones of Stress:</strong> The levels where it can survive but not reproduce or grow well.</li>
            <li><strong>Zones of Intolerance:</strong> The minimum and maximum levels beyond which it cannot survive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, fish can die if the water is too cold (minimum) or too hot (maximum). Their "ecological amplitude" is the range between these two extremes.</p>
        
        

        <h2 id="topic5">Ecological Niche </h2>
        <p>The <strong>ecological niche</strong> is one of the most important concepts in ecology. It describes the <strong>functional role</strong> and <strong>position</strong> of a species within an ecosystem.</p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            A common analogy is that the <strong>habitat</strong> is the species' "address" (where it lives), while the <strong>niche</strong> is its "profession" or "occupation" (what it does, what it eats, what eats it, and how it interacts).
        </div>
        
        <p>The niche includes all the biotic and abiotic factors a species needs to survive and reproduce, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What it eats (e.g., insects)</li>
            <li>When it eats (e.g., at night)</li>
            <li>Where it finds food (e.g., on the bark of trees)</li>
            <li>Its tolerance ranges (e.g., temperature, humidity)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Types of Niche</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fundamental Niche:</strong> The <em>full range</em> of environmental conditions and resources an organism could theoretically occupy and use, <strong>in the absence of competition</strong> and other biotic interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Realized Niche:</strong> The <i>actual</i> range of conditions and resources an organism occupies and uses, <strong>as a result of biotic interactions</strong> like competition, predation, and disease. The realized niche is always smaller than or equal to the fundamental niche.</li>
        </ul>
