        <h2 id="topic1">EIA: Definitions, Introduction, and Concepts</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction and Definition</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)</strong> is a formal, systematic process used to identify, predict, evaluate, and mitigate the potential environmental impacts (positive or negative) of a proposed project or development <strong>before</strong> any decision is made to approve or proceed with it.
        </blockquote>
        <p>In simple terms, EIA is a tool for **"looking before you leap"**. It is a **predictive** and **preventive** tool, not a reactive one. Its goal is to integrate environmental concerns into the project planning process from the very beginning.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proactive Tool:</strong> EIA anticipates problems *before* they occur, allowing for changes in the project's design or location.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision-Making Tool:</strong> It provides information to decision-makers (like government agencies) to help them decide *if* and *how* a project should proceed.</li>
            <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> EIA doesn't just identify problems; it proposes solutions (mitigation measures) to reduce or avoid negative impacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Participation:</strong> A core concept of EIA is involving the public and stakeholders in the review process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Rationale and Historical Development of EIA</h2>
        
        <h3>Rationale (Why do we need EIA?)</h3>
        <p>The main rationale for EIA is to promote <strong>sustainable development</strong>. Before EIA, projects were designed based only on technical and economic factors. This led to severe, unforeseen environmental consequences (like pollution, deforestation, and displacement) that were costly or impossible to fix later.</p>
        <p>EIA provides a way to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure environmental factors are given equal weight alongside economic and technical factors.</li>
            <li>Identify the best, least-damaging alternative for a project.</li>
            <li>Avoid long-term environmental damage and costly clean-up.</li>
            <li>Increase project transparency and accountability through public consultation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Historical Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global:</strong> EIA as a formal process began in the <strong>United States</strong> with the passage of the <strong>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1969</strong>. This was the first law to require government agencies to assess the environmental impacts of their actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread:</strong> Following the US, other countries like Canada, Australia, and European nations adopted EIA in the 1970s and 80s.</li>
            <li><strong>India:</strong> EIA was first introduced in India in <strong>1978-79</strong> for river valley projects. It was made a legal requirement for many projects under the <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</strong>. The first major, comprehensive EIA notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in <strong>1994</strong>, which has since been updated (most notably by the <strong>EIA Notification, 2006</strong>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Scope of EIA</h2>
        <p>The <strong>scope</strong> of an EIA defines the *boundaries* of the assessment. It answers the questions:
        <ul>
            <li>What potential impacts will be studied?</li>
            <li>What geographical area will be covered (the "study area")?</li>
            <li>What are the different project alternatives to be considered?</li>
            <li>What will be the time-frame of the study?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A proper scoping process (called **Scoping**) is done at the beginning of the EIA to identify the Key Issues* and avoid wasting time on irrelevant ones.</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">Methodologies of EIA</h2>
        <p>These are the different methods used to identify and predict impacts during an EIA study. No single method is perfect; they are often used in combination.</p>
