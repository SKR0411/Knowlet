        <h2 id="topic1">Soil composition</h2>
        <p>Soil is a complex mixture of four main components. A typical "ideal" loam soil consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inorganic Minerals (45%):</strong> Particles derived from weathered parent rock. These are classified by size:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sand:</strong> Large particles (gritty). Low water holding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Silt:</strong> Medium particles (silky).</li>
                    <li><strong>Clay:</strong> Very fine particles (sticky). High water holding.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Organic Matter (5%):</strong> Decomposed and decomposing plants and animals.</li>
            <li><strong>Water (25%):</strong> Held in pores between particles. Contains dissolved nutrients.</li>
            <li><strong>Air (25%):</strong> Held in pores. Provides O₂ for roots and microbes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="topic2">Relation between organic carbon and organic matter</h2>
        <p><strong>Soil Organic Matter (SOM)</strong> is a complex mix of carbon-based compounds, including living microbes, dead plant/animal "detritus," and stable humus.</p>
        <p><strong>Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)</strong> refers <em>only</em> to the carbon atoms within the SOM.
        
        <p>It is difficult to measure SOM directly, but easy to measure SOC. A long-standing convention, known as the <strong>Van Bemmelen factor</strong>, is used to convert between them.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Formula:</strong>
            <p><strong>% Soil Organic Matter (SOM) = % Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) × 1.724</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This factor is based on the assumption that SOM is, on average, 58% carbon (1 / 0.58 ≈ 1.724). This is a general approximation.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">Inorganic and organic components in soil</h2>
        
        <h3>Inorganic Components</h3>
        <p>These are the non-living, mineral parts of the soil derived from parent rock. They provide the soil's structure (<strong>texture</strong>) and are the source of most plant nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, P, etc.).</p>
        
        <h3>Organic Components</h3>
        <p>This is the <strong>Soil Organic Matter (SOM)</strong>. It is the single most important indicator of soil health. It can be divided into:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Living Biomass:</strong> Bacteria, fungi, insects, earthworms, plant roots.</li>
            <li><strong>Detritus (or "Active" SOM):</strong> Freshly dead and non-decomposed organic material (e.g., a new leaf, a dead insect). This is the "food" for the soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Humus (or "Stable" SOM):</strong> The final product of decomposition. (See next topic).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic4">Soil humus</h2>
        <p><strong>Humus</strong> is the stable, dark-colored, amorphous (shapeless) component of soil organic matter. It is what's left after microbes have decomposed the "easy" parts of detritus. It is <strong>recalcitrant</strong>, meaning it is very resistant to further decomposition and can last in the soil for hundreds of years.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Importance of Humus:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nutrient Reservoir:</strong> Humus particles are <strong>colloidal</strong> and have a strong <strong>negative charge</strong>, giving them a very high <strong>Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)</strong>. They hold onto positive plant nutrients (K⁺, Ca²⁺, etc.) like a sponge.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Retention:</strong> Humus can hold many times its own weight in water, making soil more drought-resistant.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Structure:</strong> It acts as a "glue" that binds sand, silt, and clay particles together into <strong>aggregates</strong>, which improves soil aeration and water infiltration.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic5">Cation and anion exchange reactions in soil</h2>
        <p>This is the <em>most important chemical process in soil</em> for plant nutrition.</p>
        
        <h3>Cation Exchange Reactions</h3>
        <p>Both <strong>clay</strong> particles and <strong>humus</strong> particles are naturally <strong>negatively charged</strong>.
        <br>Because opposites attract, these negative sites (called "exchange sites") attract and hold onto positively charged ions (<strong>cations</strong>) from the soil water.</p>
        
        <p>Important nutrient cations include: <strong>K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH₄⁺</strong>
        <br>Problematic acidic cations include: <strong>H⁺, Al³⁺</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>The "Exchange":</strong> The plant root releases H⁺ ions into the soil. This H⁺ "kicks" a nutrient (like K⁺) off the exchange site, and the K⁺ is then absorbed by the root.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Reaction:</strong> [Soil]⁻-K⁺ + H⁺(from root) ⇌ [Soil]⁻-H⁺ + K⁺(to root)
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC):</strong> This is a measurement of the soil's ability to hold nutrients. It is the total negative charge available in the soil.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low CEC:</strong> Sandy soils (low clay, low humus). Nutrients leach out easily.</li>
            <li><strong>High CEC:</strong> Clayey soils or soils high in humus. Very fertile, hold nutrients well.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Anion Exchange Reactions</h3>
        <p>Anions (negatively charged ions) are generally <strong>repelled</strong> by the negatively charged soil particles. This is why anions like <strong>nitrate (NO₃⁻)</strong> leach very easily from soil, causing water pollution.</p>
        <p>Some soils (especially acidic, weathered soils) can have some positive exchange sites that hold onto anions like phosphate (PO₄³⁻) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻). This is called Anion Exchange Capacity (AEC), but it's much less common than CEC.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic6">Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in soil</h2>
        <p>These are the three <strong>primary macronutrients</strong> (NPK) required by plants in the largest amounts.</p>
        
        <h3>Nitrogen (N)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Component of <strong>proteins</strong> (amino acids) and <strong>chlorophyll</strong>. Essential for leafy green growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Forms in Soil:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organic N:</strong> In humus (unavailable to plants).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ammonium (NH₄⁺):</strong> A cation, held by CEC. (Available).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrate (NO₃⁻):</strong> An anion, leaches easily. (Most common form plants take up).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> The N₂ gas in the air (78%) is unusable. It must be "fixed" by bacteria (e.g., in legume roots) or by lightning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phosphorus (P)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Component of <strong>ATP</strong> (energy transfer) and <strong>DNA</strong>. Essential for root growth, flowering, and fruiting.</li>
            <li><strong>Forms in Soil:</strong> Exists as phosphate ions (e.g., H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻).</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Phosphorus is highly <strong>immobile</strong> and its availability is extremely <strong>pH-dependent</strong>. It gets "locked up" (precipitated) with Ca in alkaline soils and with Fe/Al in acidic soils.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potassium (K)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Not part of molecules, but acts as a "regulator" for enzyme activation and, most importantly, for opening/closing <strong>stomata</strong> (leaf pores) to control water loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Form in Soil:</strong> Exists as the cation <strong>K⁺</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It is held by the soil's CEC, so it doesn't leach as easily as nitrate but is more mobile than phosphate.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            Know the function and the main available form for each NPK nutrient.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>N (Nitrate, NO₃⁻):</strong> For Proteins/Chlorophyll.</li>
                <li><strong>P (Phosphate, H₂PO₄⁻):</strong> For ATP/DNA.</li>
                <li><strong>K (Potassium, K⁺):</strong> For Water Regulation/Enzymes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="topic7">Phenolic compounds in soil</h2>
        <p><strong>Phenolic compounds</strong> are a large class of organic chemicals that contain a benzene ring bonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group. They are very common in plants.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sources:</strong> They are released into the soil from decomposing plant litter (especially from conifer needles, oak leaves) and are also a major component of <strong>humus</strong>. <strong>Tannins</strong> and <strong>lignin</strong> are complex phenolics.</li>
            <li><strong>Functions/Effects in Soil:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Allelopathy:</strong> Some plants (like eucalyptus or walnut) release phenolics that inhibit the growth of competing plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chelation:</strong> The -OH groups on phenolics can chelate metal ions, affecting their mobility and availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> They are generally hard for microbes to break down (recalcitrant), contributing to the stable humus layer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
