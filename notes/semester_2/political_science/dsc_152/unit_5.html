        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction: Two Models of Development</h2>
        <p>Since 1947, India's "development strategy" (its economic philosophy) has seen two distinct and opposing phases.  This unit explores the shift from a state-controlled model to a market-based model.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The "Planned Development" Phase (1947-1991):</strong> Characterized by socialism, state control, and the "License-Permit Raj."</li>
            <li><strong>The "Neo-liberal" Phase (1991-Present):</strong> Characterized by capitalism, market control, and the "LPG" reforms.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="planned">2. Strategy of Planned Development (1947-1991)</h2>
        <p>When India became independent, its leaders (especially Nehru) were deeply influenced by **socialism** and the success of the Soviet Union's rapid industrialization. They believed that a poor, unequal country could not develop using a "laissez-Faire" (free market) capitalist model.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>The Model: A "Mixed Economy"</strong><br>
            India adopted a "Mixed Economy," a compromise between pure capitalism and pure socialism.
            <ul>
                <li>The **"Commanding Heights"** of the economy (heavy industries, defense, railways, energy) would be controlled by the state (Public Sector Units or PSUs).</li>
                <li>A **Private Sector** would be allowed to exist but would be heavily regulated by the state.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>The Key Tool: The Planning Commission</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To implement this, the government established the **Planning Commission** in 1950 (an extra-constitutional body, now replaced by NITI Aayog). </li>
            <li>The Planning Commission created **Five-Year Plans** that set goals and allocated resources for all sectors of the economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus of Early Plans:** The early plans (especially the Second Five-Year Plan) focused on **rapid industrialization** and building a strong **heavy industry** base (steel, machinery, dams). This was known as the Mahalanobis model.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Features of the Planned Development Era:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State-led Development:</strong> The state, not private companies, was seen as the main engine of economic growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Inward-Looking (Import Substitution):</strong> The goal was self-sufficiency. India tried to produce everything *inside* the country (from cars to needles) and restricted imports with high tariffs (taxes).</li>
            <li><strong>"License-Permit Raj":</strong> The private sector was controlled by a complex system of licenses and permits. You needed government permission for everything: to start a factory, to expand, to import materials.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Outcomes of this Strategy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successes:</strong> Built a strong industrial and technological base (e.g., steel plants, dams, space program). The "Green Revolution" made India self-sufficient in food.</li>
            <li><strong>Failures:</strong> The system became corrupt and inefficient (the "License-Permit Raj"). PSUs were often unprofitable. The "Hindu rate of growth" was very slow (3-4% per year). By 1991, the system collapsed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="neo-liberal">3. Neo-liberalism: New Economic Reforms (1991-Present)</h2>
        <p>By 1991, India was facing a severe **Balance of Payments crisis**. It had almost no foreign money left to pay for essential imports like oil. It was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank for a loan.</p>
        
        <p>The loan came with conditions: India had to fundamentally *change* its economic model. This change is known as the **New Economic Reforms** or the adoption of **Neo-liberalism**. </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>What is Neo-liberalism?</strong><br>
            It is the exact *opposite* of the planned development model. It is an economic philosophy that emphasizes free markets, privatization, and a minimal role for the state.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The reforms, launched by Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, are summed up by the acronym **LPG**:</p>
        
        <h3>L - Liberalization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Freeing" the economy from state control.</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Abolishing the License-Permit Raj:** Industrial licensing was scrapped for most industries.</li>
                    <li>**De-regulation:** Businesses were free to expand, diversify, and set their own prices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>P - Privatization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Transferring ownership of state-run companies (PSUs) to the private sector.</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disinvestment:</strong> Selling shares of PSUs (like Maruti, VSNL) to the public and private companies.</li>
                    <li>The belief was that private companies are more efficient and profitable than government ones.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>G - Globalization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Integrating India's economy with the global economy. (The opposite of the "inward-looking" model).</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Allowing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** Foreign companies were now encouraged to invest and set up factories in India.</li>
                    <li>**Reducing Tariffs:** Import taxes were slashed, allowing foreign goods to enter India and compete with domestic goods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Outcomes of Neo-liberalism:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successes:</strong> Led to a high-growth phase (6-8% per year). A new middle class emerged, and consumer goods (cars, phones) became widely available. India became a global hub for IT and services.</li>
            <li><strong>Failures/Criticisms:</strong> Led to a sharp rise in *inequality*. Critics argue it led to "jobless growth," favored big corporations, and hurt farmers and the poor.</li>
        </ul>
