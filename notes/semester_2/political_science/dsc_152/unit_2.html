        <h2 id="caste">1. Major Issues in India: Caste</h2>
        <p>Caste is a system of hierarchical social division based on birth (varna and jati). In politics, it has transformed from a purely social institution into a powerful tool for political mobilization. </p>

        <h3>The Role of Caste in Politics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Caste and Elections:</strong> Parties often select candidates based on the "caste arithmetic" of a constituency, assuming people will vote for their own caste members ("vote bank" politics).</li>
            <li><strong>Politicization of Caste:</strong> This is a two-way street. Politics has *used* caste, but caste groups have also *used* politics. By organizing as a caste, previously marginalized groups (like Dalits and OBCs) have gained political power, representation, and a sense of dignity.</li>
            <li><strong>From Hierarchy to Identity:</strong> Political scientist **Rajni Kothari** argued that democracy and elections have transformed caste. It is no longer just a rigid social hierarchy; it has become a horizontal, competitive identity, a "secular" tool for bargaining with the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Mandal Commission (1990):</strong> The decision to implement reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) based on the Mandal Commission report completely reshaped Indian politics, leading to the rise of OBC-based parties (like SP, RJD) and making caste the central issue of the 1990s.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Key Quote (Attributed to Rajni Kothari):</strong> "It is not politics that gets caste-ridden; it is caste that gets politicized." This means that caste identity itself is changing (becoming a political identity) by participating in the democratic process.
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="class">2. Major Issues in India: Class</h2>
        <p>Class refers to a person's position in the economic system, based on wealth, income, and occupation (e.g., working class, middle class, capitalist class). </p>

        <h3>Caste vs. Class Debate:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For a long time, Marxist scholars argued that **class** was the "real" division in India, and caste was just a "superstructure" that would fade away with industrialization.</li>
            <li>However, in India, caste and class are deeply intertwined. For example, historically, the "upper" castes (Brahmins, Baniyas) have also been the "upper" classes (landowners, capitalists), while the "lower" castes (Dalits) have been the "lower" classes (landless laborers, urban poor).</li>
            <li><strong>Dalit Panthers:</strong> This movement in the 1970s famously argued that caste and class oppression could not be separated.</li>
            <li><strong>Today's Politics:</strong> While caste mobilization is very visible, class-based mobilization is also growing. Parties now promise "economic" benefits (e.g., EWS reservations) that cut across caste lines, or specifically target the "poor" (garib) as a political category.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="patriarchy">3. Major Issues in India: Patriarchy</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Patriarchy (literally, "rule by the father") is a social system where men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property. It is a system that creates and enforces gender inequality. 
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Patriarchy in Indian Politics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Under-representation:</strong> The most obvious sign is the low number of women in Parliament and state assemblies, far below the global average.</li>
            <li><strong>"Women's Reservation Bill":** The long-standing debate over reserving 33% of seats for women (now passed as the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam) highlights the deep resistance to sharing political power.</li>
            <li><strong>Gendered Issues:</strong> Politics often fails to address "women's issues" like domestic violence, unequal pay, and the "double burden" of work and home. Issues of "safety" are often used to *restrict* women's freedom rather than protect it.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Women's Vote":</strong> In recent years, parties have recognized that women are *not* just a part of their household's "vote bank." They are an independent voting bloc, leading to new policies targeting women (e.g., gas cylinders, cash transfers, safety schemes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="religion">4. Religion and Politics: Debates on Secularism and Communalism</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most explosive and defining debates in Indian politics. </p>
        
        <h3>Secularism</h3>
        <p>What does "secularism" mean? There are two main models:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Western Model (Separation):</strong> A "wall of separation" between religion and the state (e.g., France, USA). The state is completely neutral and does not interfere in religion, nor does religion interfere in the state.</li>
            <li><strong>The Indian Model (Principled Distance):</strong> This is unique. The state is *not* strictly separate. The state maintains a "principled distance" from all religions.
                <ul>
                    <li>It can *interfere* in religion to stop social evils (e.g., banning untouchability, reforming Hindu personal law).</li>
                    <li>It can *support* all religions equally (e.g., giving subsidies for pilgrimages).</li>
                    <li>It is an *active, interventionist* secularism, not a passive one.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communalism</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Communalism is an ideology that believes that people who follow the same religion have common social, political, and economic interests, and that these interests are different from or hostile to the interests of other religious communities.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>The Stages of Communalism:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mild:</strong> The belief that one's religious community is distinct and has unique interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> The belief that the interests of different religious communities are incompatible and divergent.</li>
            <li><strong>Extreme/Militant:</strong> The belief that the interests of different religious communities are *hostile* and cannot co-exist in the same nation, often leading to violence or calls for a separate state.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Secularism vs. Communalism Debate</h3>
        <p>This is the central political-ideological battle in India.</p>
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Position</th>
                    <th>The "Secular" Position</th>

            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Core Belief</strong></td>
                    <td>India belongs to all, regardless of faith. Diversity is a strength. The state must treat all religions with equal respect (Indian model).</td>
                    <td>(e.g., Hindu Nationalism) Believes that India is fundamentally a "Hindu" nation and that this culture must be primary.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>View of "Secularism"</strong></td>
                    <td>A foundational value of the Constitution.</td>
                    <td>A "Western" import, or a policy of "appeasement" (pseudo-secularism) that unfairly favors minorities.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Political Expression</strong></td>
                    <td>Parties advocating for minority rights, constitutional values, and the "principled distance" model.</td>
                    <td>Parties or groups advocating for policies based on the majority religion's culture (e.g., Ram Mandir, Uniform Civil Code).</td>
                </tr>

        <h2 id="exam">5. Exam Corner: Key Debates & Concepts</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Critically analyze the role of caste in contemporary Indian politics."</li>
                <li>"‘In India, class and caste are deeply intertwined.’ Discuss."</li>
                <li>"What is patriarchy? Explain its manifestations in the Indian political process." </li>
                <li>"Differentiate between the Indian and Western models of secularism."</li>
                <li>"Define communalism and analyze its impact on Indian politics." </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On Caste:</strong> You must mention **Rajni Kothari** and the "politicization of caste" thesis. The best answers show the *two-way* process: politics uses caste, and caste uses politics.</li>
                <li><strong>On Secularism:</strong> The key phrase is **"principled distance."** You must explain *how* the Indian model is different from the Western "wall of separation" model. Use the example of the state intervening to ban untouchability.</li>
                <li><strong>On Communalism:</strong> Define it as an *ideology*, not just as "riots." Explain the "stages" (mild to extreme) to show a nuanced understanding.</li>
