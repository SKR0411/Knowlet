        <h2 id="intro">1. Political Parties and the Party System in India</h2>
        
        <h3>What is a Political Party?</h3>
        <p>A political party is an organized group of people who share similar political ideologies and goals. Their primary aim is to win elections, gain political power, and implement their policies and programs for the country.</p>
        
        <h3>What is a Party System?</h3>
        <p>A "party system" refers to the set of political parties in a country and the nature of their interactions. This includes how many parties exist, their relative strength, and the rules of the game (e.g., cooperation, competition, coalition).</p>
        
        <h3>Features of the Indian Party System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Party System:</strong> Unlike the US (two-party) or China (one-party), India has a large number of political parties operating at both the national and regional levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Ideological Diversity:</strong> Parties range from the far-left (Communist) to the right-wing (BJP), with many in the "centrist" (Congress) or "regional" categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Dominated by Regional Parties:</strong> Since the 1990s, regional parties (like DMK, AIADMK, TMC, BJD) have become extremely powerful, often acting as "kingmakers" in national coalition governments.</li>
            <li><strong>Personality-Driven:</strong> Many parties are built around a single charismatic leader (e.g., TMC and Mamata Banerjee, YSRCP and Jagan Reddy) rather than a strong, impersonal ideology.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="trends">2. Trends in the Indian Party System</h2>
        <p>The Indian party system has not been static. It has undergone a profound evolution since 1947. The most significant trend is the shift from a system dominated by one party (the Congress) to a highly competitive, fragmented, and decentralized multi-party coalition system. </p>

        <h2 id="one-dominant">3. From One Dominant Party System...</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Key Concept: The "Congress System"</strong><br>
            This phase (approx. 1952-1989) is often called the **"One-Party Dominant System"** or, more accurately, the **"Congress System,"** a term coined by political scientist **Rajni Kothari**.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It was <em>not</em> a one-party state like China. Other parties existed and elections were free and fair. However, the Indian National Congress (INC) was so overwhelmingly dominant at both the Centre and in the states that it won successive large majorities.</p>
        
        <h3>Why was the Congress so Dominant?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legacy of the Freedom Struggle:</strong> It was the party of Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel; it had immense public trust and a nationwide organization.</li>
            <li><strong>"Umbrella Party":</strong> Rajni Kothari argued Congress acted as a party of consensus. It was a broad "umbrella" that brought together diverse and even conflicting groups (industrialists and workers, landlords and peasants, high-castes and low-castes) under one roof.</li>
            <li><strong>Factionalism as Strength:</strong> Factions within the Congress acted like an "internal opposition." This meant most political debates happened *inside* the Congress party, not between Congress and other parties, making the external opposition weak and irrelevant.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Opposition:</strong> The opposition was small, fragmented, and ideologically divided (Socialists, Communists, Jan Sangh), unable to form a united front.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Decline of the Congress System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1967 Elections:</strong> This was the first major shock. Congress lost power in several states, and its majority at the Centre was reduced. This marked the beginning of the end.</li>
            <li><strong>1977 Elections:</strong> After the Emergency, the Congress was defeated for the first time at the national level by the "Janata Party," a coalition of all major non-Congress parties.</li>
            <li><strong>1989 Elections:</strong> This election marked the definitive end of one-party dominance. The Congress failed to win a majority, leading to the formation of a National Front (coalition) government supported by both the BJP and the Left from the outside.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="multi-party">4. ...To Multi-Party Coalitions</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition: A "Coalition" Government</strong> is one where no single party wins a majority of seats, so two or more parties must join together to form a government, agreeing on a "Common Minimum Program."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The period from **1989 to 2014** is known as the **"Era of Coalitions."**  This phase was defined by a shift from a **"one-party dominant system"** to a **"multi-party coalition system."**</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features of the Coalition Era:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rise of Regional Parties:</strong> As the Congress weakened, political space opened up for parties representing specific regional, linguistic, or caste-based aspirations (e.g., SP, RJD, TDP, DMK).</li>
            <li><strong>Federalization of Politics:</strong> Power shifted from the Centre to the states. Chief Ministers and regional party leaders became key players in national politics.</li>
            <li><strong>Instability (at first):</strong> The early coalition governments (1989-91, 1996-99) were highly unstable and short-lived.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergence of Two "Poles":** From 1998 onwards, the system stabilized into two major pre-election alliances:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>National Democratic Alliance (NDA):</strong> Led by the BJP.</li>
                    <li><strong>United Progressive Alliance (UPA):</strong> Led by the Congress.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Politics of "Accommodation":</strong> Coalition politics is about compromise, not ideological purity. A "Common Minimum Program" (CMP) became the basis for governance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>A New Phase? (Post-2014)</h3>
        <p>Since 2014, the BJP has won a majority on its own (2014 and 2019). This has led some analysts to wonder if India is entering a *new* phase of a "BJP-dominant system," similar to the old Congress system. However, the BJP still governs as a coalition (the NDA), and regional parties remain very strong in their respective states, making the political landscape very different from the 1950s.</p>
