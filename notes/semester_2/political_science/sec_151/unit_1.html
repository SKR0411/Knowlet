        <h2 id="definition">1. Public Opinion: Definition</h2>
        <p>Public opinion is one of the most important concepts in a democracy. It is, however, notoriously difficult to define precisely.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Public opinion is the collective expression of the attitudes, beliefs, and views of a significant number of people on a given public issue or policy.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key components of the definition:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collective:</strong> It is not the opinion of a single individual, but an aggregate of many individual views.</li>
            <li><strong>Attitudes/Beliefs:</strong> It refers to what people *think* or *feel* about an issue (e.g., "I support the new environmental policy," or "I am worried about unemployment").</li>
            <li><strong>Significant Number:</strong> It doesn't have to be the *entire* population. "Public" can refer to the general public or a specific "attentive public" that cares about an issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Issue:</strong> It is not about private matters (like "what is the best color?"). It is about issues of common concern, such as politics, social problems, or the economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Important Distinction:</strong> Public opinion is <em>not</em> the same as the "will of the majority." A healthy public opinion also includes the "opinions of minorities." It is a complex, often contradictory, set of views.
        </div>

        <h2 id="characteristics">2. Characteristics of Public Opinion</h2>
        <p>To understand public opinion, we don't just ask "what" people think, but also "how" they think it. Survey researchers analyze opinion based on several key characteristics:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Direction:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the most basic measure: is the opinion <strong>for or against</strong> an issue?</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> In a survey about a new tax, the "direction" would be the percentage of people who "support" it versus the percentage who "oppose" it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Intensity:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This measures <strong>how strongly</strong> an opinion is held.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Two people might both "oppose" a policy, but one feels "somewhat opposed" (low intensity) while the other is "strongly opposed" (high intensity). High-intensity opinions are more likely to lead to political action (like protesting or donating).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stability (or Volatility):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This measures <strong>how much the opinion changes over time.</strong></li>
                    <li>An opinion is "stable" if it remains consistent (e.g., people's views on fundamental rights).</li>
                    <li>An opinion is "volatile" if it changes rapidly in response to new events or media coverage (e.g., a president's approval rating after a scandal).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Salience (or Relevance):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This measures <strong>how important an issue is</strong> to a person or the public, relative to other issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> In a given month, "inflation" might be a high-salience issue (everyone is thinking about it), while "foreign policy" might be a low-salience issue.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="role">3. Role of Public Opinion in a Democracy</h2>
        <p>In a democratic society, public opinion is the "link" between the people and the government. Its role is central to the democratic process.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ensures Accountability:</strong> The primary role of public opinion is to hold the government accountable. Politicians know that if their actions go against public opinion, they risk being voted out in the next election.</li>
            <li><strong>Guides Policy-Making:</strong> Public opinion acts as a guide for policymakers. It signals to the government what the people want, what they are worried about, and where they want the country to go.</li>
            <li><strong>Confers Legitimacy:</strong> When a government's policies are aligned with public opinion, they are seen as "legitimate." This encourages people to obey the law voluntarily, without the state needing to use force.</li>
            <li><strong>Protects Minority Rights:</strong> While democracy involves majority rule, the expression of "public opinion" (including dissent from minorities) acts as a safeguard. It highlights injustices and pressures the government to protect the rights of all.</li>
            <li><strong>Acts as a Check on Power:</strong> A visible, vocal public opinion (expressed through media, protests, or polls) prevents leaders from becoming tyrannical. It sets the boundaries of acceptable political action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="exam">4. Exam Corner: Key Concepts</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What do you understand by 'public opinion'? Discuss its main characteristics."</li>
                <li>"Explain the role of public opinion in a democratic society."</li>
                <li>"Define public opinion and distinguish it from the 'will of the majority'."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For the "Characteristics" question:</strong> You must go beyond a simple definition. Use the four key terms: <strong>Direction, Intensity, Stability, and Salience.</strong> Use a simple example (like a new tax) to explain all four.</li>
                <li><strong>For the "Role" question:</strong> Structure your answer around the key functions. The most important ones to mention are <strong>Accountability</strong> (voting), <strong>Guiding Policy</strong> (signaling), and <strong>Legitimacy</strong> (consent).</li>
                <li>A good answer will always note that "public opinion" is complex—it is not one single voice, but a collection of many voices, and a good democracy must listen to all of them.</li>
            </ul>
