        <h2 id="politics">1. Politics: Meaning and Difference</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning of Politics</h3>
        <p>The term 'Politics' originates from the Greek word <strong>'Polis,'</strong> which means 'city-state.' In ancient Greece, 'politics' simply meant 'the affairs of the city-state.'</p>
        <p>Today, politics has a much broader meaning. It is a complex and often contested concept. Here are two main views:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The "Narrow" or Traditional View (Politics as Government):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This view associates politics with the formal institutions of the state.</li>
                    <li>It is the study of <strong>government</strong>, parliament, law-making, and public administration.</li>
                    <li>In this sense, politics is a specific activity done by politicians, civil servants, and judges.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The "Broad" or Modern View (Politics as Power):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This view sees politics as a much more widespread social activity, happening in all groups and interactions.</li>
                    <li>The core of this view is the concept of <strong>power</strong> and the distribution of resources.</li>
                    <li>As the famous political scientist <strong>Harold Lasswell</strong> put it, politics is about <strong>"Who gets what, when, and how."</strong></li>
                    <li>From this perspective, politics exists everywhere: in the family (patriarchy), at the workplace (office politics), and in international relations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Key Definition:</strong> Politics is the continuous social activity of making, preserving, and amending the general rules under which people live. It is fundamentally about the exercise of power, the management of conflict, and the pursuit of collective goals.
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="comparison">2. Difference between Politics, Political Science, and Political Theory</h2>
        <p>These three terms are related but distinct. Understanding their difference is crucial.</p>

        <h2 id="theory">3. Political Theory: Meaning, Nature, Scope and Relevance</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Political Theory</h3>
        <p>Political Theory (or Political Philosophy) is the part of Political Science that deals with the <strong>normative and philosophical</strong> foundations of politics. It is a systematic reflection on political life, its institutions, and its core concepts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It asks <strong>"why?"</strong> and <strong>"what ought to be?"</strong> (normative questions).</li>
            <li>Political Science, in contrast, often asks <strong>"what is?"</strong> and <strong>"how?"</strong> (descriptive/empirical questions).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nature of Political Theory</h3>
        <p>The nature of political theory is analytical, critical, and normative.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytical:</strong> It breaks down and clarifies the meaning of core political concepts (e.g., "What do we actually mean by 'equality'?").</li>
            <li><strong>Critical:</strong> It questions and evaluates existing political systems, ideologies, and beliefs, rather than just accepting them.</li>
            <li><strong>Normative:</strong> It deals with norms and values. It seeks to build arguments for what constitutes a "good" state, a "just" society, or a "fair" law.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical:</strong> It involves studying the "great thinkers" of the past (like Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Marx) to understand how they answered these fundamental questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scope of Political Theory</h3>
        <p>The scope refers to the range of topics it covers. It is vast and includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Study of the State:</strong> Its origin, nature, purpose, and relationship with individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Core Concepts:</strong> A deep dive into all the key terms of politics: Liberty, Equality, Justice, Rights, Power, Authority, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Political Ideologies:</strong> Analyzing belief systems like Liberalism, Socialism, Conservatism, Feminism, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Debates on "Ought" Questions:</strong> Engaging in contemporary debates like, "Should the state censor speech?" or "Is protective discrimination justified?"</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Relevance of Political Theory</h3>
        <p>In a world focused on science and data, why is theory still relevant?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarifies Our Beliefs:</strong> It helps us to think systematically and critically about our own political opinions. Are they consistent? Are they justified?</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Critical Thinking:</strong> It teaches us to question assumptions, identify propaganda, and evaluate the arguments made by political leaders.</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation for Political Science:</strong> You cannot study "democracy" (Political Science) without a clear idea of what *defines* democracy (Political Theory). All empirical research is built on theoretical foundations.</li>
            <li><strong>Guides Political Action:</strong> Ideas have power. The idea of "liberty" fueled revolutions. The idea of "justice" fuels social movements. Theory provides the language and justification for political change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="exam">4. Exam Corner: Key Distinctions</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Differentiate between politics, political science, and political theory."</li>
                <li>"What is politics? Explain its traditional and modern meanings."</li>
                <li>"Explain the meaning, nature, and relevance of political theory."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For the "Difference" question:</strong> Use the <strong>Activity vs. Study vs. Foundation</strong> framework. The table provided above is a perfect structure for your answer.</li>
                <li><strong>For "Meaning of Politics":</strong> Start with the Greek root 'Polis.' Then, you MUST contrast the <strong>"narrow" (state-centric) view</strong> with the <strong>"broad" (power-centric) view</strong>. Quoting Harold Lasswell ("Who gets what, when, and how") is a classic way to score points.</li>
                <li><strong>For "Relevance of Political Theory":</strong> Don't just list its scope. Emphasize its *practical* relevance. Argue that it's not a "dead" subject but a vital tool for critical thinking and for understanding the values that shape our world.</li>
            </ul>
