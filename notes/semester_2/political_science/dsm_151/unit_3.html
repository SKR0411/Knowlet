        <h2 id="citizenship">1. Citizenship </h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Features</h3>
        <p>Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the law of a state as being a legal member of that state. It is a relationship between an individual and a state.</p>
        <p>It is a <strong>two-way street:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Individual owes:</strong> Loyalty, allegiance, obedience to laws, payment of taxes.</li>
            <li><strong>The State owes:</strong> Protection (from internal and external harm) and grants a bundle of rights (civil, political, and social).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Citizenship is about *membership* and *participation*. It separates a "citizen" (who has rights and duties) from an "alien" or "foreigner" (who is physically present but does not have the same rights, e.g., the right to vote).</p>

        <h3>Genesis and Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient Greece/Rome:</strong> Citizenship was an *elite* status. It was held only by men who owned property. It was a status of *privilege* and *duty* (the duty to participate in public life).</li>
            <li><strong>Monarchies (Middle Ages):</strong> The idea disappeared. People were not "citizens"; they were "subjects" of a King, with duties but few rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Era (Post-French Revolution):</strong> The idea was reborn. "Subject" was replaced by "Citizen." It became an *inclusive* and *equal* status, based on the idea of popular sovereignty and individual rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methods of Acquisition and Loss of Citizenship</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Acquisition (How to Get)</th>
                    <th>Loss (How to Lose)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>By Birth (Natural):</strong><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Jus Soli</strong> ("Right of the soil"): Born within the territory of the state (e.Do, USA).</li>
                            <li><strong>Jus Sanguinis</strong> ("Right of blood"): Born to parents who are citizens (e.g., India, Germany).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td><strong>Renunciation:</strong> Voluntarily giving up your citizenship (e.g., to become a citizen of another country, as India does not allow dual citizenship).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>By Naturalization (Acquired):</strong> The legal process by which a foreigner can become a citizen. This usually involves:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A period of legal residence.</li>
                            <li>Knowledge of the language/history.</li>
                            <li>An oath of allegiance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td><strong>Termination / Deprivation:</strong> If a person acquires citizenship of another country, their original citizenship may be terminated. It can also be taken away (deprived) for fraud or acts of disloyalty (e.g., treason).</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2 id="rights">2. Rights </h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Features</h3>
        <p>Rights are <strong>justified claims</strong> of an individual that are essential for their development as a human being. They are not just "wants" or "desires." A "right" implies a corresponding "duty" on others (and the state) to respect that claim.</p>
        <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Rights are social. They can only exist in a society and are enforced by the state. The state does not *give* you rights (in the moral sense), but it *recognizes* and *protects* them.</p>

        <h3>Kinds of Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Rights:</strong> Believed to be "God-given" or inherent in human nature. They exist before the state. (e.g., Locke's "Life, Liberty, and Property").</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Rights:</strong> Claims based on a society's shared sense of ethics (e.g., the right to be treated with respect).</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Rights:</strong> Claims that are recognized and enforced by the laws of a state. These are the only rights enforceable in a court. Legal rights are often divided into:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Civil Rights:</strong> Rights for protecting your life and liberty (e.g., Right to Life, Freedom of Speech, Equality before Law).</li>
                    <li><strong>Political Rights:</strong> Rights to participate in government (e.g., Right to Vote, Right to Contest Elections).</li>
                    <li><strong>Social/Economic Rights:</strong> Rights to a decent standard of living (e.g., Right to Work, Right to Education, Right to Healthcare).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Human Rights & the UNO</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What are Human Rights?</strong> They are a modern fusion of "natural" and "legal" rights. They are rights that belong to *all* human beings, *regardless* of their citizenship, race, gender, or any other status. They are universal.</li>
            <li><strong>The Role of the UNO:</strong> The United Nations Organization (UNO) was founded in 1945. One of its central missions is to promote and protect human rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):</strong> The foundational document. Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, it sets out (for the first time) the fundamental human rights to be universally protected.
                <ul>
                    <li>It includes *both* Civil/Political rights (e.g., "no one shall be subjected to torture") and Social/Economic rights (e.g., "everyone has the right to education").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> The UN is not a world government; it cannot easily *force* countries to comply. But it "names and shames," sends rapporteurs, and has created international treaties (covenants) like the ICCPR and ICESCR to make these rights legally binding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="state">3. State </h2>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The "State" is the central concept of political science. It is a political association that establishes sovereign power within a defined territory. It is the most powerful institution in society.</p>
        <p>A state is defined by four essential elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Population:</strong> There must be a group of people.</li>
            <li><strong>Territory:</strong> A defined geographical area (land, water, air).</li>
            <li><strong>Government:</strong> The machinery or agency that runs the state and makes/enforces laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> This is the most important element. It means the state has supreme and final legal authority.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal Sovereignty:</strong> It is superior to all other groups *within* its territory.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Sovereignty:</strong> It is independent and free from *outside* control (e.g., from other countries).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Evolution</h3>
        <p>The state has evolved over time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient City-State:</strong> (e.g., Athens) Small, unified, direct participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Roman Empire:</strong> A vast, centralized, bureaucratic state.</li>
            <li><strong>Feudal State (Medieval):</strong> Power was *not* centralized. It was fragmented between the King, feudal lords, and the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Nation-State:</strong> (Emerged 16th-17th C.) Created by the <strong>Treaty of Westphalia (1648)</strong>. This is the model we have today, based on territory and absolute sovereignty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relationship between State and Civil Society</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>State:</strong> The sphere of <strong>public, coercive power</strong>. It includes the government, police, military, courts. You *must* obey the state.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Civil Society:</strong> The sphere of <strong>private, voluntary association</strong>. It is the "third sector" that exists between the family (private) and the state (public).
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Examples of Civil Society:</strong> NGOs, community groups, religious organizations, trade unions, student clubs, media (when independent).</p>
        
        <h4>The Relationship:</h4>
        <p>The relationship is complex. They can be partners or adversaries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As Adversaries:</strong> Civil society acts as a "watchdog" to check and limit state power. When the state is oppressive, civil society organizes protests and resistance (e.g., human rights NGOs).</li>
            <li><strong>As Partners:</strong> The state may work *with* civil society to achieve goals (e.g., partnering with NGOs to deliver healthcare or education).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A strong, active civil society is considered essential for a healthy democracy, as it prevents the state from becoming too powerful and gives citizens a voice.</p>

        <h2 id="exam">4. Exam Corner: Key Distinctions</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What is citizenship? Explain the different methods of acquiring citizenship." </li>
                <li>"What are Rights? Discuss the role of the UNO in protecting Human Rights." </li>
                <li>"Define the State and its essential elements." </li>
                <li>"Distinguish between the State and Civil Society." </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Citizenship:</strong> You must use the Latin terms <strong>Jus Soli</strong> ("right of soil") and <strong>Jus Sanguinis</strong> ("right of blood") when discussing acquisition by birth.</li>
                <li><strong>For Rights & UNO:</strong> You MUST mention the **UDHR (1948)**. Explain that Human Rights are universal and that the UN's role is to promote them through documents, treaties, and diplomacy.</li>
                <li><strong>For State:</strong> The answer is incomplete without listing all **four elements** (Population, Territory, Government, Sovereignty). Emphasize that <strong>Sovereignty</strong> is the most important, defining feature.</li>
                <li><strong>For State vs. Civil Society:</strong> This is a classic. The key distinction is <strong>Coercive vs. Voluntary</strong> and <strong>Public vs. Private</strong>. A great answer will also explain their relationship (adversarial and partnership).</li>
            </ul>
