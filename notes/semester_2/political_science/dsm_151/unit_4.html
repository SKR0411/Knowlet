        <h2 id="debate1">1. Debate 1: Is Democracy Compatible with Economic Growth? </h2>
        <p>This is a major real-world debate. The question is: Do countries have to choose between political freedom (democracy) and economic prosperity (growth)?</p>

        <h3>The Argument: Democracy HINDERS Economic Growth</h3>
        <p>This view, often called the <strong>"Lee Thesis"</strong> (after Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew), argues that authoritarian or "strong" governments are better for economic development, especially in the beginning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Argument 1: Efficiency & Stability.</strong> Authoritarian states can make tough, unpopular decisions (like building a dam, freezing wages) quickly, without facing protests, media criticism, or election cycles. This "stability" is attractive to investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument 2: Focus on Long-Term.</strong> Democrats must pander to voters with "populist" short-term policies (like subsidies) to win the next election. A dictator can focus on long-term goals (like building infrastructure) that may be painful now but pay off in 20 years.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Proof" (Examples):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>China:</strong> The fastest economic growth in human history happened under an authoritarian one-party state.</li>
                    <li><strong>South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore:</strong> All had their "miracle" growth phases under military dictatorships or one-party rule. They "democratized" *after* they got rich.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Argument: Democracy HELPS Economic Growth</h3>
        <p>This argument, championed by economists like <strong>Amartya Sen</strong>, holds that democracy is not a luxury, but is essential for sustainable and just development.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Argument 1: Prevents Famines.</strong> Sen's famous observation: "No major famine has ever taken place in a functioning democracy." Why? Because a government that faces voters and a free press cannot ignore mass starvation. It is forced to act.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument 2: Information & Accountability.</strong> A free press and an active opposition act as "error-correction" mechanisms. They expose corruption and bad policies *before* they become disasters. (e.g., in a dictatorship, a bad policy can continue for years because no one can criticize it).</li>
            <li><strong>Argument 3: Sustainable Growth.</strong> Growth in dictatorships can be brittle and based on cronyism. Democratic growth, while perhaps slower, is more stable, inclusive, and based on "human capability" (education, health), which is the true driver of long-term wealth.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Proof" (Examples):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>India:</strong> Slower, messier growth than China, but has avoided catastrophes like China's "Great Leap Forward" famine. Its growth is stable and based on a strong private sector.</li>
                    <li><strong>Botswana:</strong> A stable democracy in Africa that has had excellent, non-corrupt growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Conclusion of the Debate:</strong> The evidence is mixed. There are democratic failures (like some countries in Africa) and democratic successes (like India, USA). There are authoritarian failures (like North Korea) and authoritarian successes (like China).
            <br>
            The consensus is: <strong>There is no direct, causal link.</strong> Growth is not *guaranteed* by either system. However, democracy is undeniably better at creating <strong>human development</strong> (health, education, political freedom), which Amartya Sen calls the true "end" of development.
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="debate2">2. Debate 2: Is Censorship Justified? </h2>
        <p>Censorship is the suppression of speech, art, or communication by the state (or another authority) on the grounds that it is objectionable, harmful, or sensitive.</p>
        <p>This debate is a direct clash between the value of <strong>Liberty</strong> (specifically, freedom of speech) and other values like <strong>Security, Order,</strong> or <strong>Morality</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Case FOR Censorship (Grounds of Justification)</h3>
        <p>No one argues for 100% censorship. The argument is that "freedom of speech" is not absolute and can be *reasonably restricted* in certain cases:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The "Harm Principle" (J.S. Mill):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the most famous liberal justification for limits.</li>
                    <li><strong>John Stuart Mill</strong> argued that your freedom can be limited *only* if your actions (or speech) cause direct, physical *harm* to another person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> You are free to believe what you want, but you are not free to shout "Fire!" in a crowded theatre (causing a panic) or to incite a mob to violence ("Let's go and burn his house!").</li>
                    <li>This justifies censoring **Hate Speech** or **Incitement to Violence**.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>National Security:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The argument that the state must be able to censor information to protect itself from external enemies or internal rebellion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Banning the publication of state secrets, troop movements during wartime, or websites that recruit for terrorist organizations. This is the "reasonable restriction" mentioned in Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Public Order & Morality:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a more controversial ground. It's the argument for censoring things that are not "harmful" in the physical sense, but are considered "offensive" to the community's moral standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Censoring art or films for "obscenity," "blasphemy" (insulting religion), or "indecency."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Protecting the Vulnerable:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a widely accepted ground.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Censoring child pornography (which is an absolute ban) or creating film ratings (A, U/A) to prevent children from seeing adult content.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Case AGAINST Censorship (The Limits)</h3>
        <p>The "pro-free speech" side argues that while some limits (like incitement to violence) are necessary, most censorship is dangerous and illegitimate.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who Decides? (The "Slippery Slope"):</strong> This is the strongest argument. The problem isn't the *idea* of censoring "harmful" things; the problem is *who* gets to decide what is "harmful," "obscene," or "anti-national"?
                <ul>
                    <li>The "slippery slope" argument says that if you give the government the power to censor "bad" speech, it will inevitably use that power to censor speech it *disagrees* with—like political criticism, dissent, and inconvenient truths.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The "Marketplace of Ideas" (J.S. Mill):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mill argued that the *only* way to find the truth is to allow all ideas (true and false) to compete in a "marketplace of ideas."</li>
                    <li>If you censor a false idea, you lose the opportunity to prove *why* it is false.</li>
                    <li>If you censor a *true* idea, society loses the truth.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, the only "cure" for bad speech is *more* speech, not censorship.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chilling Effect:</strong> When censorship exists, people become afraid to say anything controversial, even if it's legal. This "chills" free expression and leads to self-censorship, which is poison for a democracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Is democracy a pre-condition for or an obstacle to economic growth? Discuss." </li>
                <li>"‘Freedom of speech is not absolute.’ Discuss the grounds on which censorship can be justified." </li>
                <li>"What is the 'Harm Principle'? How does it relate to the debate on censorship?" </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer a Debate Question:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Clearly state the two sides of the debate. (e.g., "The relationship between democracy and growth is complex, with some arguing it helps and others that it hinders...").</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (Side A):</strong> Lay out the arguments for one side. (e.g., "The case FOR censorship rests on..."). Use your keywords: "National Security," "Harm Principle," "Obscenity."</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 2 (Side B):</strong> Lay out the arguments for the other side. (e.g., "On the other hand, critics of censorship argue..."). Use your keywords: "Slippery Slope," "Marketplace of Ideas," "Chilling Effect."</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis & Conclusion:</strong> This is where you score high. Don't just list the arguments; *analyze* them. Show the tension. (e.g., "While democracy may be slower, Amartya Sen's argument about famines suggests it creates more sustainable human development...")</li>
                <li><strong>Use Key Thinkers:</strong> Naming <strong>Amartya Sen</strong> for the growth debate and <strong>J.S. Mill (Harm Principle)</strong> for the censorship debate is essential.</li>
