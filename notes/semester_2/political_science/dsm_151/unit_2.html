        <h2 id="democracy">1. Democracy</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning</h3>
        <p>The term 'Democracy' comes from two Greek words: <strong>'Demos'</strong> (people) and <strong>'Kratos'</strong> (rule or power). It literally means <strong>'rule by the people.'</strong></p>
        <p>At its core, democracy is a system of government where supreme power is vested in the people, who exercise it either directly or through their freely elected representatives. Abraham Lincoln's definition is classic: "Government of the people, by the people, for the people."</p>

        <h3>Forms of Democracy</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Direct Democracy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>People *directly* participate in decision-making and law-making. They don't elect representatives; they *are* the government.</li>
                    <li>This was practiced in ancient Greek city-states (like Athens) where all citizens could gather to vote.</li>
                    <li>Today, it's impractical for large nations, but its tools survive in some places (e.g., Switzerland) as:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Referendum:</strong> People vote directly on a proposed law.</li>
                            <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> People can propose a law themselves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recall:</strong> People can vote to remove an elected official.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Indirect (Representative) Democracy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the modern form. People *elect* representatives (MPs, MLAs) to make decisions on their behalf.</li>
                    <li>This is the system used in India, the USA, the UK, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Characteristics of Democracy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> The people are the ultimate source of all political power.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Equality:</strong> Embodied in the "One Person, One Vote, One Value" principle.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> No one is above the law, not even the government. The constitution is supreme.</li>
            <li><strong>Fundamental Rights & Liberties:</strong> Guarantees of free speech, assembly, religion, etc., are essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Free, Fair, and Regular Elections:</strong> A mechanism to hold the government accountable.</li>
            <li><strong>Majority Rule, Minority Rights:</strong> The government rules by majority, but it cannot oppress the minority.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Merits and Demerits</h3>
        <div class="add-horizontal-scroll"><table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Merits (Pros)</th>
                    <th>Demerits (Cons)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Accountability:</strong> Leaders are accountable to the people and can be voted out.</td>
                    <td><strong>Instability:</strong> Governments can change frequently, leading to policy paralysis.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> Decisions are seen as legitimate because they reflect the "will of the people."</td>
                    <td><strong>Slow Decision-Making:</strong> Requires consultation and debate, which is time-consuming.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Protects Rights:</strong> Best system for protecting individual liberty and human dignity.</td>
                    <td><strong>"Tyranny of the Majority":</strong> The majority may use its power to oppress minorities.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Peaceful Change:</strong> Allows for a "revolution" without bloodshed—through the ballot box.</td>
                    <td><strong>Risk of Demagoguery:</strong> Can be captured by charismatic but dangerous leaders who appeal to emotion over reason.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table></div>

        <h3>The Pre-conditions for the Success of Democracy</h3>
        <p>Democracy is not automatic; it needs the right conditions to flourish.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Widespread Education:</strong> An alert and educated citizenry is needed to make informed choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Consciousness:</strong> People must be aware of their rights and duties.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Security:</strong> A "hungry" person is more interested in food than in a vote. Extreme poverty can be a threat to democracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Press & Media:</strong> To act as a "watchdog" and provide unbiased information.</li>
            <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> To protect the constitution and citizens' rights from government overreach.</li>
            <li><strong>Culture of "Toleration":</strong> A willingness to respect different opinions and a spirit of compromise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="liberty">2. Liberty</h2>
        
        <h3>Definition and Features</h3>
        <p>Liberty (or Freedom) is the ability to think and act as one wishes, without coercion or external constraints. It is often considered the highest political value.</p>
        <p>A key feature is that liberty is not "license." License means absolute freedom to do anything, including harming others. Liberty, in a political sense, is *ordered freedom*—it exists within the bounds of law that prevents one person's freedom from destroying another's.</p>

        <h3>Forms of Liberty</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Liberty:</strong> The (hypothetical) absolute freedom people had in the "state of nature" before government (a concept used by thinkers like Rousseau).</li>
            <li><strong>Civil Liberty:</strong> The freedoms that citizens enjoy in a state, protected by law (e.g., freedom of speech, movement).</li>
            <li><strong>Political Liberty:</strong> The freedom to participate in the political process (e.g., right to vote, contest elections).</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Liberty:</strong> Freedom in the economic sphere (e.g., freedom to choose one's profession, own property).</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Liberty:</strong> "Freedom *from*..." It means the absence of external constraints (e.g., no one is stopping you from speaking).</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Liberty:</strong> "Freedom *to*..." It means the presence of the capacity and opportunity to be your own master (e.g., having an education so your speech is meaningful).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Safeguards of Liberty</h3>
        <p>How can we protect our freedom?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A written <strong>Constitution</strong> with a Bill of Rights.</li>
            <li>An <strong>Independent Judiciary</strong> to act as the guardian of those rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule of Law</strong> (supremacy of law).</li>
            <li><strong>Separation of Powers</strong> (between legislative, executive, judicial) to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.</li>
            <li>A <strong>Free Press</strong> and strong <strong>Civil Society</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty"</strong> - a conscious and alert citizenry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="equality">3. Equality</h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Features</h3>
        <p>Political equality does <strong>not</strong> mean that everyone is (or should be) identical or have the exact same outcomes. It is a normative concept that all human beings are of <strong>equal moral worth</strong> and should be treated with equal respect and concern.</p>
        <p>Its main feature is the *rejection* of special privileges based on arbitrary factors like birth, race, caste, or gender.</p>

        <h3>Kinds of Equality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Formal (or Legal) Equality:</strong> "Equality before the law." The law applies to everyone equally, without fear or favor.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Equality:</strong> "One person, one vote, one value." Equal right to participate in political life.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Equality:</strong> Absence of discrimination or privilege based on caste, race, gender, etc. It demands equal status in society.</li>
            <li><strong>Equality of Opportunity:</strong> Everyone should have a "level playing field" and an equal chance to develop their talents and succeed, regardless of their background.</li>
            <li><strong>Equality of Outcome:</strong> A more radical (socialist) idea that society must aim for a rough equality in *actual conditions* (wealth, health), as "equality of opportunity" is meaningless if people start from vastly different places.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relation between Liberty and Equality</h3>
        <p>This is a classic debate. Are freedom and equality friends or enemies?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>View 1: They are Opposed (Conflict):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Argued by classical liberals and libertarians (like Lord Acton).</li>
                    <li>The argument: To make everyone "equal" (e.g., in wealth), the state must use force to take from the rich (violating their economic liberty) and give to the poor.</li>
                    <li>Forcing equality, in this view, always destroys liberty.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>View 2: They are Complementary (Friends):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Argued by modern liberals, socialists, and thinkers like Rousseau.</li>
                    <li>The argument: What is "liberty" to a person who is starving or has no education? Extreme inequality of wealth and power makes a mockery of liberty.</li>
                    <li>In this view, a certain level of equality (in social and economic spheres) is *essential* for true liberty to be enjoyed by all.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="justice">4. Justice</h2>

        <h3>Development of the Idea</h3>
        <p>Justice is the oldest and most central concept of political theory. It is about "giving each person their due."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient View (Plato):</strong> Justice was about harmony and fulfilling one's proper role. A "just city" was one where each class (Rulers, Soldiers, Producers) did its own job and did not interfere with others.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern View:</strong> The focus shifted to *individual* rights and *fairness* in distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Justice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Procedural Justice:</strong> Focuses on the fairness of the *process*. The outcome is just if the rules were fair and applied fairly (e.g., a fair trial, a fair race).</li>
            <li><strong>Distributive Justice:</strong> Focuses on the fairness of the *outcome*. Is the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and honors in society fair? (This is the focus of Rawls).</li>
            <li><strong>Corrective/Retributive Justice:</strong> Focuses on "righting wrongs." It's the basis for criminal law (e.g., a punishment that "fits the crime").</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rawls' Theory of Justice</h3>
        <p>This is the most important modern theory of distributive justice, developed by <strong>John Rawls</strong> in his book *A Theory of Justice* (1971).</p>
        <p>He asks: How can we find fair principles of justice for our society?</p>
        
        <h4>The "Original Position" & "Veil of Ignorance"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rawls proposes a thought experiment: Imagine we are all in an <strong>"Original Position"</strong> before society begins. We have to agree on the basic rules (principles of justice).</li>
            <li>Crucially, we are all behind a <strong>"Veil of Ignorance."</strong> This means we do *not* know anything about our personal situation:
                <ul>
                    <li>We don't know if we'll be rich or poor.</li>
                    <li>We don't know if we'll be talented or disabled.</li>
                    <li>We don't know our race, gender, or religion.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Logic:</strong> Since you don't know if you'll end up at the top or the very bottom, you will rationally choose principles that are fair to everyone, especially the worst-off, just in case that's you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Two Principles of Justice</h4>
        <p>Rawls argues we would all agree on two principles (in this order):</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Liberty Principle:</strong> Everyone has an equal claim to the most extensive set of basic liberties (freedom of speech, vote, etc.), compatible with the same liberties for all. (This comes first).</li>
            <li><strong>The Social and Economic Principle:</strong> Social and economic inequalities are acceptable *only if* they meet two conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a) Fair Equality of Opportunity:</strong> All jobs and positions must be open to everyone under fair conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>b) The Difference Principle:</strong> Any inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the *least-advantaged* members of society.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Exam Tip on Rawls:</strong> The "Difference Principle" is the radical part. Rawls is *not* a socialist; he allows inequality. But he says inequality (e.g., a doctor earning more) is only "just" if that system also benefits the poorest person (e.g., by providing them with healthcare).
        </blockquote>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What are the pre-conditions for the success of democracy?"</li>
                <li>"Explain the relationship between Liberty and Equality."</li>
                <li>"Critically examine John Rawls's theory of justice."</li>
                <li>"What are the safeguards of Liberty?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On Democracy:</strong> Don't just list merits/demerits. Focus on the *pre-conditions*, as this is a common question. Link them: "Education is a pre-condition because an uneducated public is prone to demagoguery, which is a demerit of democracy."</li>
                <li><strong>Liberty vs. Equality:</strong> This is a classic. You MUST explain *both* views (Conflict vs. Complementary). A good answer concludes that a balance is needed.</li>
                <li><strong>On Rawls:</strong> You will fail this question if you do not mention the **"Original Position,"** the **"Veil of Ignorance,"** and the **"Difference Principle."** These are the three pillars of his theory.</li>
