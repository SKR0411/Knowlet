        <h2 id="pm">1. The Prime Minister (PM)</h2>
        <p>If the President is the *Head of State*, the Prime Minister is the <strong>*Head of Government*</strong>. In India's parliamentary system, the PM is the *de facto* (real) executive and holds the most powerful office in the country.</p>

        <h3>Appointment of the PM</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Article 75(1)</strong> states that "the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President." </li>
            <li>This doesn't mean the President has a free choice. By convention, the President *must* appoint the leader of the majority party (or majority coalition) in the <strong>Lok Sabha</strong>.</li>
            <li>If no party has a clear majority (a "hung parliament"), the President uses his discretion, usually inviting the leader of the single largest party or coalition to form a government and prove their majority.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Role and Functions of the PM</h3>
        <p>The PM is the "keystone of the cabinet arch" and the leader of the nation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Head of the Council of Ministers:</strong> The PM *selects* all other ministers, *allocates* their portfolios (ministries), and can ask any minister to resign or have them dismissed by the President.</li>
            <li><strong>Presides over Cabinet:</strong> He is the chairman of the Cabinet and a-half all its meetings. His influence is paramount in all policy decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Link between President and Cabinet:</strong> (Art 78) It is the PM's duty to communicate all decisions of the CoM to the President.</li>
            <li><strong>Leader of the Nation:</strong> The PM is the chief spokesperson for the country on all major national and international issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Leader of the House:</strong> As the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha, the PM guides the legislative agenda.</li>
            <li><strong>Head of Key Institutions:</strong> The PM is the ex-officio Chairman of NITI Aayog, the National Development Council, and the National Integration Council.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="com">2. Union Council of Ministers (CoM)</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Article 74:</strong> "There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice."
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Composition of the Council</h3>
        <p>The Council of Ministers is the large body of all ministers. It has a three-tiered structure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cabinet Ministers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most senior ministers, who hold the most important portfolios (e.g., Home, Defence, Finance, External Affairs).</li>
                    <li>They form the <strong>"Cabinet,"</strong> which is the small, inner core of the CoM. The Cabinet meets regularly and makes all key policy decisions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ministers of State (MoS):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The second rank. They can either be given <strong>"Independent Charge"</strong> of a ministry or be <strong>"attached"</strong> to a Cabinet Minister to assist them.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Deputy Ministers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most junior rank, they are not given independent charge and are attached to Cabinet Ministers or MoS to assist with administrative duties.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Powers and Functions of the CoM</h3>
        <p>The CoM (specifically the Cabinet) is the *real* executive of India. Its functions are vast:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Formulation:</strong> It formulates all domestic and foreign policies of the country.</li>
            <li><strong>Legislative Control:</strong> It drafts and introduces most of the bills (over 90%) in Parliament.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Control:</strong> It prepares and presents the annual Union Budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Control over Administration:</strong> It directs the entire government machinery (the bureaucracy) and is responsible for implementing laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Advisory Role:</strong> It "aids and advises" the President, and this advice is binding (after the 42nd and 44th Amendments).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="relation">3. Relationship between PM and Union Council of Ministers</h2>
        <p>While the CoM is "collectively" powerful, its relationship with the PM is one of *subordination*. The PM is the "sun around which the other ministers revolve."</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Formation:</strong> The CoM comes into existence only after the PM is appointed.</li>
            <li><strong>Allocation:</strong> The PM decides who gets which ministry.</li>
            <li><strong>Dismissal:</strong> The PM can demand any minister's resignation at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Centrality:</strong> The PM presides over meetings and his decision is often final.</li>
            <li><strong>Dissolution:</strong> The PM's resignation or death automatically dissolves the *entire* Council of Ministers. A minister's resignation, however, only creates a vacancy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This dynamic makes the PM exceptionally powerful, far more than just a "first among equals" (primus inter pares).</p>

        <h2 id="exam">4. Exam Corner: Key Concepts & Articles</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Discuss the appointment, role, and functions of the Prime Minister of India." </li>
                <li>"Explain the composition and powers of the Union Council of Ministers." </li>
                <li>"Analyze the relationship between the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers." </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Articles:</strong> You must mention **Article 74** (CoM to aid and advise President) and **Article 75** (PM appointed by President).</li>
                <li><strong>Collective Responsibility:</strong> When discussing the CoM, the most important concept is <strong>"Collective Responsibility."</strong> This (from Art 75) means the *entire* ministry is responsible to the *Lok Sabha* as a single unit. They "swim and sink together." A vote of no-confidence against one minister (or the PM) is a vote against the entire government.</li>
                <li><strong>PM's Power:</strong> When analyzing the PM-CoM relationship, explain that while the CoM is collectively responsible, the PM has *individual* power over its formation, allocation, and dissolution.</li>
            </ul>
