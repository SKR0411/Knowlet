        <h2 id="parliament">1. The Parliament of India: Composition</h2>
        <p>The Parliament is the supreme legislative body of India. It is <strong>bicameral</strong> (has two Houses). [cite_start]As per the Constitution, Parliament consists of[cite: 356]:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The President</li>
            <li>The Lok Sabha (House of the People / Lower House)</li>
            <li>The Rajya Sabha (Council of States / Upper House)</li>
        </ol>

        <table style="width:100%">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Lok Sabha (House of the People)</th>
                    <th>Rajya Sabha (Council of States)</th>
                </tr>

                    <td><strong>Permanent Body</strong> (cannot be dissolved). Members have a 6-year term; 1/3rd retire every 2 years.</td>

        <h2 id="powers">2. Powers and Functions of Parliament</h2>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Legislative Powers:</strong> To make laws on all subjects in the Union List and Concurrent List[cite: 356].</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Powers:</strong> Parliament controls the finances. No tax can be levied and no money spent without its approval. The <strong>Union Budget</strong> must be passed by Parliament.</li>
            <li><strong>Executive Powers:</strong> The government (CoM) is collectively responsible to the Parliament (specifically the Lok Sabha). [cite_start]Parliament controls the executive through various methods[cite: 356].</li>
            <li><strong>Constituent Powers:</strong> The power to amend the Constitution (as per Article 368).</li>
            <li><strong>Judicial Powers:</strong> Can impeach the President and remove judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="relation">3. Relationship between Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha</h2>
        <p>In most matters, they have equal powers. A non-money bill must be passed by *both* Houses. [cite_start]However, the <strong>Lok Sabha is more powerful</strong> than the Rajya Sabha[cite: 356].</p>
        
        <h3>Why Lok Sabha is more powerful:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Money Bills:</strong> A Money Bill can *only* be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha cannot reject or amend it; it can only delay it for 14 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Responsibility:</strong> The Council of Ministers is responsible *only* to the Lok Sabha. [cite_start]A "No-Confidence Motion" can only be moved and passed in the Lok Sabha[cite: 356].</li>
            <li><strong>Joint Sitting:</strong> In case of a deadlock on an ordinary bill, the President can call a joint sitting. Because the Lok Sabha has more than double the members, it will always win the vote.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Special Powers of Rajya Sabha:</h3>
        <p>The Rajya Sabha has two unique powers that the Lok Sabha does not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Art. 249:</strong> Can authorize Parliament to make a law on a subject in the *State List* in the national interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Art. 312:</strong> Can authorize Parliament to create a new *All-India Service*.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="control">4. Parliamentary control over the Executive</h2>
        <p>This is the essence of the parliamentary system. The legislature (Parliament) keeps a check on the executive (government).</p>
        <h3>Tools of Control:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Hour:</strong> The first hour of a sitting where ministers must answer questions from MPs. This is a powerful tool for accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero Hour:</strong> A less formal device where MPs can raise matters of urgent importance.</li>
            <li><strong>Motions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adjournment Motion:</strong> To set aside normal business and debate an urgent public matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cut Motions:</strong> Moved during the budget to show disapproval of a policy (can be to cut demand by Re. 1).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Financial Control:</strong> The government cannot spend a single rupee without Parliament's approval (passing the Budget).</li>
            <li><strong>No-Confidence Motion:</strong> The ultimate weapon. [cite_start]If this motion is passed in the Lok Sabha, the government (PM and CoM) *must* resign[cite: 356].</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="judiciary">5. Judiciary in India: Structure</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>India has a <strong>single, integrated, and independent</strong> judicial system[cite: 356].</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent:</strong> It is separate from the executive and legislature. This is ensured by security of tenure for judges, fixed salaries, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated:</strong> It is a single pyramid. The laws (both central and state) are enforced by one unified system.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The structure is: <strong>Supreme Court</strong> (at the apex) -> <strong>High Courts</strong> (at the state level) -> <strong>District and Subordinate Courts</strong> (at the local level).</p>

        <h2 id="sc">6. The Supreme Court: Composition and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court (SC) is the highest court in India. Its decisions are binding on all other courts.</p>
        
        <h3>Composition:</h3>
        <ul>
            [cite_start]<li>Consists of the <strong>Chief Justice of India (CJI)</strong> and other judges (currently up to 33, for a total of 34)[cite: 356].</li>
            <li>Judges are appointed by the President after consulting with other judges (the "Collegium system").</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Jurisdiction (Powers):</h3>
        [cite_start]<p>The SC has a wide range of powers[cite: 356]:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Original Jurisdiction:</strong> The power to hear a case for the first time. This applies to disputes between:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Centre and one or more States.</li>
                    <li>The Centre and States vs. other States.</li>
                    <li>Two or more States.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Appellate Jurisdiction:</strong> The power to hear appeals against judgments from lower courts (High Courts). This is the SC's primary work.</li>
            <li><strong>Writ Jurisdiction (Art. 32):</strong> The power to issue *writs* (Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, etc.) to enforce Fundamental Rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Advisory Jurisdiction (Art. 143):</strong> The power to give its *opinion* to the President on a question of law or fact. (This advice is not binding).</li>
            <li><strong>Court of Record:</strong> Its judgments are recorded as legal precedents and are binding on all lower courts.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="review">7. Judicial Review</h2>
        <blockquote>
            [cite_start]<strong>Definition:</strong> Judicial Review is the power of the judiciary (Supreme Court and High Courts) to examine the *constitutionality* of laws passed by the legislature and actions taken by the executive[cite: 356].
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To act as the <strong>"Guardian of the Constitution"</strong> and the "Protector of Fundamental Rights."</li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> If a law or executive action is found to be in *violation* of the Constitution (e.g., it takes away a Fundamental Right), the court can declare it <strong>"null and void"</strong> (unconstitutional).</li>
            <li><strong>Basis:</strong> This power is derived from Article 13 (laws inconsistent with FRs are void) and Article 32 (Right to Constitutional Remedies).</li>
            <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It establishes a "synthesis" in India: Parliament is *not* supreme (like in the UK) because its laws can be struck down. But the judiciary is also not fully supreme, as Parliament can amend the Constitution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="exam">8. Exam Corner: Key Concepts</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                [cite_start]<li>"Differentiate between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, highlighting why the Lok Sabha is more powerful." [cite: 356]</li>
                [cite_start]<li>"What is Judicial Review? Explain its significance." [cite: 356]</li>
                [cite_start]<li>"Discuss the various tools of parliamentary control over the executive." [cite: 356]</li>
                [cite_start]<li>"Explain the composition and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India." [cite: 356]</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LS vs. RS:</strong> The two key points of Lok Sabha's superiority are <strong>Money Bills</strong> and <strong>Collective Responsibility</strong> (No-Confidence Motion).</li>
                <li><strong>Parliamentary Control:</strong> You must mention the <strong>No-Confidence Motion</strong> as the most drastic tool, and <strong>Question Hour</strong> as the most common.</li>
                <li><strong>Judicial Review:</strong> Define it as the power to check *constitutionality*. Call it the "Guardian of the Constitution."</li>
                <li><strong>Judiciary Structure:</strong> Use the word <strong>"Integrated"</strong> to describe the single, pyramidal structure.</li>
