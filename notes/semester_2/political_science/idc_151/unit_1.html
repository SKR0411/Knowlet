        <h2 id="making">1. Making of the Constitution</h2>
        <p>The Constitution of India was not drafted by a single person but by a representative body called the <strong>Constituent Assembly</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> The Assembly was formed in 1946 based on the <strong>Cabinet Mission Plan</strong>. Its members were elected *indirectly* by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies.</li>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Though indirectly elected, it included representatives from all sections of Indian society—Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, Anglo-Indians, Christians, SCs, and STs.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dr. Rajendra Prasad:</strong> President of the Assembly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:</strong> Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He is recognized as the "Father of the Indian Constitution."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Objectives Resolution:</strong> On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru moved the "Objectives Resolution," which laid down the philosophical foundations of the Constitution. This resolution was later adopted as the <strong>Preamble</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The Assembly took <strong>2 years, 11 months, and 18 days</strong> to complete the draft, holding 11 sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> The final draft was adopted on <strong>November 26, 1949</strong> (celebrated as Constitution Day).</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> The Constitution came into full effect on <strong>January 26, 1950</strong> (celebrated as Republic Day).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="preamble">2. The Preamble</h2>
        <p>The Preamble is the introduction or preface to the Constitution. It outlines the basic philosophy, objectives, and guiding principles of the Constitution.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Text of the Preamble:</strong><br>
            "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a
            <strong>SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC</strong>
            and to secure to all its citizens:<br>
            <strong>JUSTICE</strong>, social, economic and political;<br>
            <strong>LIBERTY</strong> of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;<br>
            <strong>EQUALITY</strong> of status and of opportunity;<br>
            and to promote among them all<br>
            <strong>FRATERNITY</strong> assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;<br>
            IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do
            HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key Concepts in the Preamble:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sovereign:</strong> India is an independent nation, free from any external control.</li>
            <li><strong>Socialist:</strong> (Added by 42nd Amendment, 1976). Aims to achieve a "democratic socialist" society, focused on reducing inequality of income and resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Secular:</strong> (Added by 42nd Amendment, 1976). The state has no official religion. It follows a model of "principled distance," treating all religions with equal respect.</li>
            <li><strong>Democratic:</strong> The government derives its authority from the will of the people, expressed through free and fair elections.</li>
            <li><strong>Republic:</strong> The head of the state (the President) is an *elected* official, not a hereditary monarch (like the King or Queen of Britain).</li>
            <li><strong>Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity:</strong> These are the four main objectives that the Constitution seeks to achieve for its citizens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="features">3. Salient Features</h2>
        <p>The Indian Constitution is unique in its content and spirit. Its main features are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lengthiest Written Constitution:</strong> It is the most detailed and longest-written constitution in the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawn from Various Sources:</strong> It is a "borrowed" constitution, taking the best features from many other countries:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>UK:</strong> Parliamentary government, Rule of Law, Single Citizenship.</li>
                    <li><strong>USA:</strong> Fundamental Rights, Judicial Review, Impeachment of President.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ireland (Eire):</strong> Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP).</li>
                    <li><strong>Canada:</strong> "Quasi-federal" system (a strong Centre).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility:</strong> It is neither too rigid (like the US) nor too flexible (like the UK). Some parts can be amended by a simple majority, while others require a special majority.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal System with Unitary Bias:</strong> It's a federal structure (two levels of government, division of powers). However, the Centre is made stronger than the states (e.g., Emergency provisions, Single Citizenship). It is often called <strong>"Quasi-Federal."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Parliamentary Form of Government:</strong> The executive (Prime Minister & Council of Ministers) is drawn from and responsible to the legislature (Parliament). This is the "Westminster" model.</li>
            <li><strong>Fundamental Rights:</strong> (Part III) These are justiciable rights that protect citizens from the arbitrary power of the state.</li>
            <li><strong>Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP):</strong> (Part IV) These are non-justiciable guidelines to the state to work towards a welfare state.</li>
            <li><strong>Fundamental Duties:</strong> (Part IVA) Added by the 42nd Amendment, these are moral obligations on the citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Independent and Integrated Judiciary:</strong> A single, unified judicial system with the Supreme Court at the top, acting as the "guardian of the Constitution."</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Adult Franchise:</strong> Every citizen above 18 years has the right to vote, regardless of caste, creed, gender, or income.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Citizenship:</strong> Unlike the USA, all citizens of India are citizens of *India*, not of their state.</li>
        </ol>
