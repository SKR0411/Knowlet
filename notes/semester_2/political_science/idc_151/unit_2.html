        <h2 id="rights">1. The Fundamental Rights (Part III)</h2>
        <p>The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III (Articles 12-35) of the Constitution. They are often called the "Magna Carta" of India. They are fundamental because they are essential for the all-round development of an individual and are protected by the Constitution.</p>
        
        <h3>Nature of Fundamental Rights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Justiciable:</strong> This is their most important feature. If a Fundamental Right is violated, a citizen can go directly to the High Court (Art 226) or the Supreme Court (Art 32) to get it enforced.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative and Positive:</strong> Some are "negative" (prohibiting the state from doing something, e.g., "no discrimination"), while others are "positive" (requiring the state to do something).</li>
            <li><strong>Not Absolute:</strong> They are not unlimited. The state can impose "reasonable restrictions" on them in the interest of national security, public order, morality, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Six Fundamental Rights:</h3>
        <p>Originally there were seven, but the "Right to Property" was removed by the 44th Amendment (1978). The six rights are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Right to Equality (Art. 14-18):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Art. 14:</strong> Equality before law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Art. 15:</strong> Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Art. 16:</strong> Equality of opportunity in public employment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Art. 17:</strong> Abolition of Untouchability.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Right to Freedom (Art. 19-22):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Art. 19:</strong> Guarantees six freedoms (Speech, Assembly, Association, Movement, Residence, Profession).</li>
                    <li><strong>Art. 21:</strong> Protection of Life and Personal Liberty. This has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the Right to Education, Right to Health, Right to Clean Environment, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Right against Exploitation (Art. 23-24):</strong> Prohibits human trafficking, forced labor (begar), and child labor.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Freedom of Religion (Art. 25-28):</strong> Guarantees freedom of conscience, and the right to profess, practice, and propagate religion.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural and Educational Rights (Art. 29-30):</strong> Protects the interests, language, and culture of minorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Art. 32):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Called the "Heart and Soul of the Constitution" by Dr. Ambedkar.</li>
                    <li>It gives citizens the right to move the Supreme Court to enforce their other Fundamental Rights. The SC can issue *writs* (like Habeas Corpus, Mandamus) for this.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="duties">2. The Fundamental Duties (Part IVA)</h2>
        <p>The Fundamental Duties were *not* in the original Constitution. They were added in 1976 by the **42nd Amendment** based on the recommendations of the **Swaran Singh Committee**.</p>
        
        <h3>Nature of Fundamental Duties:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Justiciable:</strong> Unlike Rights, the Duties are not enforceable by courts. They are moral and civic obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To serve as a reminder to citizens that while they enjoy rights, they also have duties towards the nation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Key Duties (Article 51A):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions (e.g., the National Flag and Anthem).</li>
            <li>To cherish the noble ideals of the freedom struggle.</li>
            <li>To protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.</li>
            <li>To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood.</li>
            <li>To protect and improve the natural environment.</li>
            <li>To develop a scientific temper and humanism.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="dpsp">3. Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV)</h2>
        <p>The DPSP are enshrined in Part IV (Articles 36-51) of the Constitution. They are borrowed from the Irish Constitution. They represent the "socialist" or "welfare" goals of the Constitution.</p>

        <h3>Nature of DPSP:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Justiciable:</strong> Like Fundamental Duties, they are not enforceable by courts. A citizen cannot sue the government for not implementing a DPSP.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> They are "fundamental in the governance of the country." They are a set of instructions or *directives* to future governments to work towards a **social and economic democracy**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Classification of DPSP (for study):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Socialistic Principles:</strong> Aim for social and economic justice. (e.g., Art. 39 - reduce inequality, provide equal pay for equal work).</li>
            <li><strong>Gandhian Principles:</strong> Reflect the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. (e.g., Art. 40 - organize village panchayats; Art. 47 - prohibit intoxicating drinks).</li>
            <li><strong>Liberal-Intellectual Principles:</strong> Reflect modern liberal thought. (e.g., Art. 44 - secure a Uniform Civil Code; Art. 50 - separate judiciary from executive; Art. 51 - promote international peace).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="relation">4. Relationship between Rights and Principles</h2>
        <p>This is a classic debate: What happens when a Fundamental Right (justiciable) conflicts with a Directive Principle (non-justiciable)?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial View:</strong> Fundamental Rights are superior (e.g., *Champakam Dorairajan case*).</li>
            <li><strong>Modern View (Minerva Mills case):** The Supreme Court held that the Constitution is founded on the "bedrock" of balance between Part III (Rights) and Part IV (DPSP). They are **"two wheels of a chariot"** and are complementary. One (Rights) provides political democracy, while the other (DPSP) provides the vision for social and economic democracy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="exam">5. Exam Corner: Key Distinctions</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What are the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution?" </li>
                <li>"What are Directive Principles? Explain their main types." </li>
                <li>"Differentiate between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy."</li>
