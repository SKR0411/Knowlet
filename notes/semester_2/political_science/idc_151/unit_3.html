        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction: The Union Executive</h2>
        <p>The Union Executive (Part V of the Constitution) consists of the President, Vice-President, Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers.</p>
        <p>India has a parliamentary system. This means it has two "heads":</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The President:</strong> The <strong>Head of State</strong>. He is the *de jure* (nominal or titular) executive. He represents the nation, but does not "rule." </li>
            <li><strong>The Prime Minister:</strong> The <strong>Head of Government</strong>. He is the *de facto* (real) executive, who holds the real power.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="election">2. The President: Election</h2>
        <p>The President of India is *not* elected directly by the people. He is elected *indirectly* by an <strong>Electoral College</strong>.</p>
        <p>This Electoral College consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elected</strong> members of the Lok Sabha (House of the People).</li>
            <li><strong>Elected</strong> members of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).</li>
            <li><strong>Elected</strong> members of the Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabhas) of all the States.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Who is NOT included?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>*Nominated* members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.</li>
            <li>*All* members (elected and nominated) of the State Legislative Councils (Vidhan Parishads).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The election is held using the system of <strong>Proportional Representation</strong> by means of the <strong>Single Transferable Vote (STV)</strong>. This system ensures that the winning candidate has the support of a broad section of the country's representatives.</p>

        <h2 id="impeachment">3. Impeachment Procedure (Article 61)</h2>
        <p>The President can only be removed from office for <strong>"Violation of the Constitution"</strong> through a process called Impeachment.</p>
        
        <h3>The steps are as follows:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The charge can be initiated in <strong>either House</strong> of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).</li>
            <li>The charges must be signed by at least <strong>one-fourth (1/4th)</strong> of the members of that House.</li>
            <li>A <strong>14-day notice</strong> is given to the President.</li>
            <li>The resolution is then moved and must be passed by a <strong>special majority of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the *total* strength</strong> of that House.</li>
            <li>The charge is then sent to the *other* House, which acts as an investigating body. The President has the right to appear and be represented at this investigation.</li>
            <li>If the second House also passes the resolution by a <strong>special majority of 2/3rd of the *total* strength</strong>, the President stands impeached from that moment.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Note:</strong> This is a "quasi-judicial" (partly legal) and very difficult process. No Indian President has ever been impeached.
        </div>

        <h2 id="powers">4. Powers and Functions</h2>
        <p>The President's powers are extensive but, in practice, he exercises them only on the <strong>"aid and advice"</strong> of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Powers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Executive Powers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>All executive actions of the government are taken in his name.</li>
                    <li>He appoints the Prime Minister, Council of Ministers, Governors, Supreme Court and High Court Judges, Attorney General, and CEC.</li>
                    <li>He is the Supreme Commander of the armed forces.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legislative Powers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>He summons and prorogues (ends a session of) Parliament and can dissolve the Lok Sabha.</li>
                    <li>A bill passed by Parliament becomes a law *only* after the President gives his assent.</li>
                    <li>He can use his <strong>Veto Power</strong> (Absolute, Suspensive, and Pocket Veto).</li>
                    <li>He nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Financial Powers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>No "Money Bill" can be introduced in Parliament without his prior recommendation.</li>
                    <li>He controls the Contingency Fund of India.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Judicial Powers (Pardoning Power - Art 72):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>He has the power to grant a <strong>pardon, reprieve, respite, remission, or commutation</strong> of a sentence, including the death sentence.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="emergency">5. Emergency Powers</h2>
        <p>The Constitution provides for three types of emergencies that the President can declare:</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Article 356 (President's Rule) is highly controversial and has often been used for political purposes. The Financial Emergency (Art 360) has *never* been used in India.

        <h2 id="exam">6. Exam Corner: Key Articles & Processes</h2>
