        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction: The Idea of Justice </h2>
        <p>Justice is often called the "first virtue" of social institutions. It is the core concept of political philosophy, concerned with the principle of "giving each person their due." But what, exactly, is "due" to a person? This question has led to different, competing theories of justice.</p>
        <p>This unit explores three major ways of understanding justice: one focused on the *process* (procedural), one on the *outcome* (distributive), and one on the *scope* (global).</p>

        <h2 id="procedural">2. Procedural Justice </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Procedural justice (or "justice as fairness of process") is a theory that emphasizes the fairness of the <strong>rules and procedures</strong> used to make decisions and allocate goods.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The outcome is considered "just" if and only if the process to reach it was fair, impartial, and applied consistently. The focus is on *how* a decision is made, not *what* the decision is.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Thinker:</strong> Robert Nozick (in *Anarchy, State, and Utopia*). He argues for an "entitlement theory" of justice:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Justice in Acquisition:</strong> You justly acquire property if it's un-owned and you don't harm others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Justice in Transfer:</strong> You justly transfer property through voluntary exchange (trade, gift).</li>
                </ol>
                Nozick argues that any distribution, no matter how unequal, is *just* if it arrived through these fair procedures (no force, no fraud).</li>
            <li><strong>Role of State:</strong> Minimal. The state's only role is to enforce these procedures (e.g., enforce contracts, protect from theft). Taxing the rich to help the poor is seen as unjust, a form of "forced labor."</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A fair trial in a court of law. Even if a guilty person is acquitted, the verdict is considered "just" in a procedural sense if all rules (right to a lawyer, rules of evidence) were followed. A fair lottery is another perfect example.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="distributive">3. Distributive Justice </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Distributive justice is a theory that emphasizes the fairness of the <strong>outcomes or distribution</strong> of resources, wealth, opportunities, and honors in a society.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The focus is on *who gets what* and whether that final distribution is fair. It asks, "What is a just and fair arrangement of society's benefits and burdens?"</li>
            <li><strong>Key Thinker:</strong> **John Rawls** (in *A Theory of Justice*). His theory is the most important modern theory of distributive justice.</li>
            <li><strong>Principles of Distribution:</strong> Different societies distribute goods based on different principles:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To each according to need</strong> (Socialism)</li>
                    <li><strong>To each according to merit/desert</strong> (Meritocracy)</li>
                    <li><strong>To each according to their contribution</strong> (Capitalism)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Role of State:</strong> Active. The state is required to intervene (e.g., through taxes, welfare, public services) to ensure the distribution of goods meets a standard of fairness.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Progressive income tax (where the wealthy pay a higher percentage of their income) is a classic mechanism of distributive justice, reallocating resources to fund public education, healthcare, and welfare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="rawls">4. Spotlight: John Rawls's Theory of Distributive Justice </h2>
        <p>Because Rawls is so central to this topic, his ideas  are crucial. He asks: "What principles of justice would free and rational people agree to?" To find out, he proposes a thought experiment:</p>
        
        <h3>The Original Position & Veil of Ignorance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Original Position:</strong> A hypothetical "pre-society" state where everyone gathers to choose the basic rules (the principles of justice) for their society.</li>
            <li><strong>Veil of Ignorance:</strong> The key part. In this Original Position, everyone is behind a "veil of ignorance." You do <em>not</em> know:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your class or social status (rich or poor)</li>
                    <li>Your natural talents (smart or strong)</li>
                    <li>Your race, gender, or religion</li>
                    <li>Your idea of "the good life"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Logic:</strong> Since you don't know if you'll end up as a rich CEO or a poor, disabled person, you will choose principles that are fair to *everyone*, especially the worst-off. You'll want to design a society that is safe to be born into in any position.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Two Principles of Justice</h3>
        <p>Rawls argues we would all agree on two principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Liberty Principle:</strong> Everyone has an equal claim to the most extensive set of basic liberties, compatible with the same liberties for all. (e.g., freedom of speech, right to vote). This comes first.</li>
            <li><strong>The Social and Economic Principle:</strong> Social and economic inequalities are acceptable *only if* they meet two conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a) Fair Equality of Opportunity:</strong> All jobs and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of fair competition.</li>
                    <li><strong>b) The Difference Principle:</strong> Any inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the *least-advantaged* members of society. (e.g., a doctor can earn more than a cleaner, but only if that system also provides healthcare to the cleaner).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Rawls's theory is a form of liberal egalitarianism. It's not pure socialism (it allows inequality) but it's not pure libertarianism (it judges inequality by its effect on the poor).
        </div>

        <h2 id="global">5. Global Justice </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Global justice is the extension of distributive justice to a global scale. It questions whether justice and fairness apply only *within* a state, or between *all people* in the world.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Questions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do the citizens of rich nations owe to the citizens of poor nations?</li>
                    <li>Are national borders morally significant?</li>
                    <li>Is global poverty an injustice, or just a misfortune?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Debate:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cosmopolitans (e.g., Thomas Pogge):</strong> Argue that justice applies to all *individuals* globally. National borders are "morally arbitrary." We have a strong duty to help the global poor, just as we do our fellow citizens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statists/Communitarians (e.g., Michael Walzer):</strong> Argue that justice is a concept that applies *within* a specific political community (the state). Our duties to our fellow citizens are much stronger than our duties to foreigners.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Debates over international foreign aid, the responsibilities of rich countries for climate change, and fair-trade rules are all debates about global justice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="exam">6. Exam Corner: Key Distinctions & Thinkers</h2>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What do you understand by the 'Idea of Justice'?" </li>
                <li>"Differentiate between procedural and distributive justice, using examples." </li>
                <li>"Critically examine John Rawls's theory of justice." </li>
                <li>"What is global justice? Discuss the key debates surrounding it." </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Procedural vs. Distributive:</strong> The key is <strong>Process vs. Outcome</strong>. Use the thinkers: **Nozick** for Procedural, **Rawls** for Distributive.</li>
                <li><strong>Rawls's Theory:</strong> You MUST mention the **"Veil of Ignorance"** and the **"Difference Principle."** These are the two most important and unique parts of his theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Justice:</strong> Frame your answer around the central debate: **Cosmopolitanism vs. Statism** (or Communitarianism). Are borders morally important or not?</li>
