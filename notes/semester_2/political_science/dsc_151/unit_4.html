        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction: The Concept of Rights </h2>
        <p>A **right** is an entitlement or a justified claim to have or to do something. Rights are central to modern politics because they define the relationship between the individual and the state. They create a "protected sphere" for the individual, setting limits on what the state and other people can do to them.</p>
        <p>This unit explores what it means for rights to be "universal" and breaks them down into different categories: by their source (Natural, Moral, Legal) and by their historical evolution (Three Generations).</p>

        <h2 id="universality">2. Universality of Rights </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> The concept of **universality** means that rights are possessed by all human beings, everywhere, simply by virtue of being human. They are <strong>inalienable</strong> (they cannot be taken away) and <strong>indivisible</strong> (all rights are equally important).
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Your rights do not depend on your citizenship, race, gender, religion, or any other characteristic. A human being in India has the same fundamental rights as a human being in the USA, China, or Brazil.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Document:</strong> This idea is most famously expressed in the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)**, adopted by the United Nations in 1948. Its first article states, "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."</li>
            <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This concept provides a global standard of morality and law, allowing us to criticize the actions of governments (including our own) when they violate these fundamental norms.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> This concept is *debated*. The challenge to universality is known as "Cultural Relativism," which is a key topic in Unit 5. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="types">3. Types of Rights: Natural, Moral, and Legal </h2>
        <p>We can classify rights based on their *source* or justification:</p>
        
        <h3>Natural Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Believed to be inherent in "human nature" or "endowed by God." They exist *before* and *independent* of any government or law.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Thinker:</strong> **John Locke**, who argued that all people possess in the "state of nature" the natural rights to **Life, Liberty, and Property.**</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> They are seen as universal and inalienable. The purpose of government, for Locke, was precisely to *protect* these pre-existing natural rights.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Moral Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Based on shared ethical principles and a sense of justice within a community. They are "rights" that we believe people *ought* to have, even if they aren't written down in law.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> They are not legally enforceable but carry strong persuasive weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> If a person makes a promise, the other person has a "moral right" to its fulfillment. We may say animals have a "moral right" to be treated humanely, even if legal protections are weak.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Granted by a specific legal system (e.g., a constitution, an Act of Parliament). They are "posited" or created by human law.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> They are enforceable by law, but they are *not* universal—they only apply to those under that specific legal system. They can also be changed, created, or abolished by the government.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> The right to vote at 18, the right to a minimum wage, or the right to drive a car. These are rights given by law, not "nature."</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Relationship:</strong> The entire history of human rights advocacy is the struggle to transform **Natural/Moral Rights** (e.g., "all people *should* be free") into **Legal Rights** (e.g., a constitutional amendment that guarantees freedom).
        </div>

        <h2 id="generations">4. The Three Generations of Rights </h2>
        <p>This is a popular framework, proposed by Czech jurist Karel Vasak, to classify rights based on their historical evolution. It links them to the three slogans of the French Revolution:</p>

        <h3>First Generation Rights (Blue Rights)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slogan:</strong> "Liberty"</li>
            <li><strong>Category:</strong> **Civil and Political Rights**</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> These are "negative" rights. They protect the individual *from* the state. They demand state inaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Emerged from the 18th-century liberal revolutions (American and French) and the struggles against absolute monarchy.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right to life</li>
                    <li>Freedom of speech, press, and assembly</li>
                    <li>Freedom of religion</li>
                    <li>Right to a fair trial, right to vote</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Second Generation Rights (Red Rights)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slogan:</strong> "Equality"</li>
            <li><strong>Category:</strong> **Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights**</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> These are "positive" rights. They require the state to *act* and *provide* for its citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Emerged from the 19th-century socialist and social-democratic movements in response to industrial capitalism and widespread poverty.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right to education</li>
                    <li>Right to healthcare</li>
                    <li>Right to work and fair wages</li>
                    <li>Right to social security (pensions, unemployment benefits)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third Generation Rights (Green Rights)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slogan:</strong> "Fraternity" (Solidarity)</li>
            <li><strong>Category:</strong> **Collective or Solidarity Rights**</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> These rights are held by *groups* or *peoples*, not just individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Emerged from the 20th-century decolonization movement and growing global concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right to self-determination of peoples</li>
                    <li>Right to economic and social development</li>
                    <li>Right to a clean and healthy environment</li>
                    <li>Right to peace</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p><strong>Common Exam Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Explain the concept of 'Universality of Rights'." </li>
                <li>"Distinguish between Natural, Moral, and Legal rights." </li>
                <li>"Write a detailed essay on the 'Three Generations of Rights'." </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Answer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For the "Three Generations" question:</strong> Don't just list them. Use the table structure. Explain the *historical context* for each, the *nature* of the right (negative/positive/collective), and the *role* it implies for the state.</li>
                <li><strong>For "Universality":</strong> Define the concept clearly (all people, all places, just by being human). A good answer will also *hint* at the upcoming debate (Unit 5) by saying, "This idea is challenged by cultural relativists..."</li>
                <li><strong>For "Types of Rights":</strong> The key is the *source* of the right. Is it from Nature/God? Is it from ethics? Or is it from law? Use Locke as your key thinker for Natural Rights.</li>
