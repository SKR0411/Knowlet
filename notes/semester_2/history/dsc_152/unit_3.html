            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_8">1. Timur's Invasion and its Consequences (1398)</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_9">By the end of the 14th century, the Tughluq dynasty had become very weak due to internal rebellions and the weak successors of Firoz Shah. This weakness invited a devastating invasion.</span></p>
            
            <h3><span id="spap_10">The Invasion:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_11"><strong>Who was Timur?</strong> Timur (or Tamerlane) was a Turco-Mongol conqueror from Central Asia (Samarkand). He was a brutal and highly effective military commander.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_12"><strong>Motive:</strong> His motive was plunder and religious war (<em>jihad</em>). He had no intention of staying in India.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>The Sack of Delhi (1398):</strong> He marched to Delhi, where he defeated the weak Tughluq army. He then entered the city and, over several days, his army engaged in a horrifying <strong>massacre and plunder</strong>. Delhi, which had been the prosperous capital for centuries, was left completely shattered and depopulated.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span id="spap_14">Consequences:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>End of the Tughluq Dynasty:</strong> The invasion was a death blow to the Tughluq dynasty. It completely collapsed, though its "rulers" nominally held on for a few more years.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_16"><strong>Political Chaos:</strong> The authority of the Delhi Sultanate was destroyed. This led to the rise of independent <strong>regional kingdoms</strong> across India (e.g., in Gujarat, Malwa, and Jaunpur).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Economic Ruin:</strong> The plunder of wealth and the massacre of artisans, combined with the destruction of agriculture, caused a severe economic collapse.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Paving the Way for the Sayyids:</strong> Timur appointed <strong>Khizr Khan</strong>  as his governor in the Punjab region. This Khizr Khan would later march on Delhi to establish the next dynasty, the Sayyids.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_19">2. Political history under the Sayyids (1414-1451)</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_20">The Sayyid dynasty is a minor and relatively insignificant dynasty that ruled over a much-diminished Sultanate.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_21"><strong>Khizr Khan (1414-1421):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_22">He was the founder of the dynasty.</span> </li>
                        <li><span id="spap_23">He did not take the title of 'Sultan'. Instead, he ruled as <strong>'Rayat-i-Ala'</strong> (the highest-ranking noble) and claimed to be a representative of Timur's son, Shah Rukh.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_24">His entire reign was spent trying to control rebellious nobles and re-establish authority over the areas immediately surrounding Delhi.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_25"><strong>Mubarak Shah (1421-1434):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_26">Son of Khizr Khan, he was the first Sayyid ruler to openly adopt the title of 'Sultan'.</span> </li>
                        <li><span id="spap_27">He was a more capable ruler and managed to suppress some rebellions.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_28">He was eventually assassinated by his own nobles.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_29"><strong>Later Rulers:</strong> The subsequent rulers were weak and incompetent. The last Sayyid ruler, Ala-ud-din Alam Shah, peacefully abdicated the throne to <strong>Bahlul Lodi</strong>, the Afghan governor of Punjab, and retired.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic3"><span id="spap_30">3. Political history under the Lodis (1451-1526)</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_31">The Lodis were the <strong>first Afghan dynasty</strong> to rule the Delhi Sultanate (the previous dynasties were all Turkic). They were based on a different concept of kingship.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_32"><strong>Bahlul Lodi (1451-1489):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_33">He was the founder. His kingship was based on the Afghan idea of being <strong>'primus inter pares'</strong> (first among equals).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_34">He did not sit on a throne but on a carpet with his Afghan nobles, treating them as colleagues rather than subjects. This was necessary to secure their loyalty.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_35">His main achievement was the conquest of the independent kingdom of Jaunpur.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_36"><strong>Sikander Lodi (1489-1517):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_37">He was the <strong>greatest Lodi Sultan</strong>.</span> </li>
                        <li><span id="spap_38"><strong>Shift in Kingship:</strong> He dropped his father's "first among equals" policy. He re-introduced a more authoritarian, Balban-style monarchy, forcing his nobles to show him respect and obedience.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_39"><strong>Economic Reforms:</strong> He was a good administrator, abolished corn duties, and introduced a new land measurement system called the <strong>'Gaz-i-Sikandari'</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_40"><strong>New Capital:</strong> To control the Rajputs, he founded a new city in 1504: <strong>Agra</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_41"><strong>Religious Bigotry:</strong> He was also known for his religious intolerance, destroying Hindu temples (e.g., at Mathura) and persecuting non-orthodox Muslim sects.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_42"><strong>Ibrahim Lodi (1517-1526):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_43">The last Lodi Sultan. He was arrogant and high-headed.</span> </li>
                        <li><span id="spap_44">He tried to centralize power further and humiliated his senior Afghan nobles.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_45">This alienated the nobles, who began to conspire against him.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_46">Two of these disgruntled nobles, <strong>Daulat Khan Lodi</strong> (Governor of Punjab) and <strong>Alam Khan Lodi</strong>, invited <strong>Babur</strong>, the ruler of Kabul, to invade India and overthrow Ibrahim.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic4"><span id="spap_47">4. The First Battle of Panipat (1526): Causes and Consequences</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_48">This battle marks the end of the Delhi Sultanate and the beginning of the Mughal Empire. It was fought between <strong>Ibrahim Lodi</strong> and <strong>Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur</strong>.</span></p>

            <h3><span id="spap_49">Causes:</span></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span id="spap_50"><strong>Babur's Ambition:</strong> Babur, a descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan, had lost his ancestral kingdom in Central Asia. He established himself in Kabul and was ambitious to conquer India, which he considered his "ancestral" territory (due to Timur's conquest).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_51"><strong>Ibrahim Lodi's Unpopularity:</strong> As mentioned, Ibrahim's arrogant behavior had created many enemies within his own empire.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_52"><strong>The Invitation:</strong> Disloyal nobles like Daulat Khan Lodi sent a formal invitation to Babur, giving him a perfect opportunity to invade.</span></li>
            </ol>

            <h3><span id="spap_53">The Battle (April 21, 1526):</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_54"><strong>Armies:</strong> Ibrahim Lodi had a massive army (perhaps 100,000 men and 1,000 elephants), but it was poorly organized. Babur had a small, compact, and battle-hardened army (around 12,000-15,000 men).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_55"><strong>Babur's Superior Tactics:</strong> Babur won due to two key military innovations:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_56"><strong>Gunpowder & Artillery:</strong> He was the first to use <strong>field artillery (cannons)</strong> effectively on an Indian battlefield.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_57"><strong>Tulughma Tactic:</strong> A classic Central Asian tactic. He divided his army into a center, left, and right, with two "flanking parties" that wheeled around to attack the enemy from the sides and rear, encircling them.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_58"><strong>Result:</strong> Babur's cannons terrified Ibrahim's elephants, and the <em>Tulughma</em> tactic trapped the large Lodi army. Ibrahim Lodi was killed on the battlefield.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span id="spap_61">Consequences:</span></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span id="spap_62"><strong>End of the Delhi Sultanate:</strong> The battle brought the 320-year-old Delhi Sultanate to an end.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_63"><strong>End of the Lodi Dynasty:</strong> The Lodi dynasty was extinguished, and Afghan power was broken (though temporarily).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_64"><strong>Foundation of the Mughal Empire:</strong> Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, laying the foundation for the <strong>Mughal Empire</strong>, which would rule India for the next 300 years.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_65"><strong>New Era in Warfare:</strong> The battle signaled a revolution in Indian warfare, marking the end of the age of elephant and cavalry charges and the beginning of the age of gunpowder and artillery.</span></li>
