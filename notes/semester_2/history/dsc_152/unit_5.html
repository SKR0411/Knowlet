            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_8">1. Bhakti Movement</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_9">The Bhakti Movement was a socio-religious reform movement that swept across medieval India. It emphasized <strong>personal devotion (Bhakti)</strong> to a single god as the path to salvation, rejecting complex rituals, idol worship, and the caste system.</span></p>
            <p><span id="spap_10"><strong>Key Features:</strong></span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_11">Emphasis on <strong>love and devotion</strong> to God.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_12">Rejection of empty rituals, ceremonies, and the authority of priests.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>Monotheism:</strong> Belief in one God (though known by many names, like Ram or Rahim).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Equality:</strong> Strong opposition to the caste system, preaching that all humans are equal.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>Use of Vernacular:</strong> The saints composed songs and poems in the <strong>local languages</strong> (like Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Assamese) rather than Sanskrit, to reach the common people.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span id="spap_16">Prominent Saints:</span></h3> 
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Kabir:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_18">A central figure, he was a weaver from Varanasi.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_19">He was the strongest critic of both formal Hinduism and Islam, rejecting idol worship and pilgrimages.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_20">He preached a formless god (<em>Nirguna Bhakti</em>) and emphasized Hindu-Muslim unity, famously stating, "Ram and Rahim are the same."</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_21"><strong>Nanak (Guru Nanak):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_22">Born in Punjab, he was the founder of <strong>Sikhism</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_23">He preached the worship of one formless God (<em>Nirankar</em>) and the equality of all.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_24">His teachings are collected in the Guru Granth Sahib.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_25"><strong>Chaitanya (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_26">A saint from Bengal, he was a devotee of Krishna (<em>Saguna Bhakti</em> - devotion to a god with form).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_27">He popularized the practice of <strong>'Kirtan'</strong> (group devotional singing and dancing) as a way to achieve spiritual ecstasy.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_28"><strong>Srimanta Sankardev:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_29">A great saint-reformer of <strong>Assam</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_30">He founded the <strong>Ekasarana Dharma</strong> (Neo-Vaishnavism), focusing on the worship of a single god, Krishna (or Vishnu).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_31">He created new forms of art and culture to spread his message, such as <strong>Borgeet</strong> (devotional songs), <strong>Ankia Naat</strong> (one-act plays), and <strong>Sattriya</strong> dance.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_32">He established <strong>Sattras</strong> (monasteries) and <strong>Namghars</strong> (community prayer halls) which became the center of religious and social life in Assam.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_33">2. Sufi Movements</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_34">Sufism is the mystical branch of Islam. Like the Bhakti saints, Sufis emphasized <strong>love, devotion, and a personal connection to God</strong>, rather than rigid dogma.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_35"><strong>Core Ideas:</strong> The goal of a Sufi is to achieve union with God (Allah) through love, devotion, and contemplation. They believed in serving humanity as a way of serving God.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_36"><strong>Silsilahs (Orders):</strong> Sufis were organized into different orders or 'silsilahs'. The two most important in India were:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_37"><strong>Chishti Silsilah:</strong> The most popular and liberal order. Its saints (like <strong>Moinuddin Chishti</strong> of Ajmer and <strong>Nizamuddin Auliya</strong> of Delhi) lived simple lives, stayed away from state politics, and embraced the poor. They famously used <strong>'Qawwali'</strong> (musical gatherings) to arouse spiritual devotion.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_38"><strong>Suhrawardi Silsilah:</strong> This order was more orthodox, accepted state patronage and wealth, and actively participated in politics.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_39"><strong>Impact:</strong> Sufism was very popular among the common people, both Hindus and Muslims. Their message of love and social equality, and their use of local languages, made them a powerful force for <strong>Hindu-Muslim unity</strong>.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic3"><span id="spap_40">3. Administration of Delhi Sultanate</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_41">The Delhi Sultanate was a <strong>military theocracy</strong>, with the Sultan as the supreme head. The administration was a mix of Islamic theory and Indian traditions.</span></p>
            
            <h3><span id="spap_42">Central Administration:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_43"><strong>The Sultan:</strong> He was the all-powerful head of state, chief military commander, and chief justice. Balban and Alauddin Khalji created a highly centralized, absolute monarchy.</span></li>

            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_61">This was the backbone of the Sultanate's administration, introduced by Iltutmish.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_62">The empire was divided into provinces called <strong>'Iqtas'</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_63">These Iqtas were assigned to military commanders (called <strong>'Iqtadars'</strong> or <em>Muqtis</em>).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_64"><strong>Duties of the Iqtadar:</strong>
                    <ol>

                        <li><span id="spap_66"><strong>Collect Revenue:</strong> To collect taxes from the people.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_67"><strong>Maintain an Army:</strong> From this revenue, he would pay his own salary, and most importantly, maintain a large body of troops for the Sultan's service.</span></li>

                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_69">The Iqta was <strong>not hereditary</strong> (in theory). The Iqtadar could be transferred or dismissed by the Sultan at any time (until Firoz Shah Tughluq made it hereditary).</span></li>

            <p><span id="spap_71">The Sultanate, which lasted for 320 years, declined and finally fell due to a combination of factors.</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li><span id="spap_72"><strong>Despotic and Centralized Rule:</strong> The Sultanate was based on military power. If the king was strong (like Balban or Alauddin), the empire was strong. If the king was weak, the empire fell apart.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_73"><strong>Weak Successors:</strong> After strong rulers, there were often weak, incompetent successors. The weak successors of Firoz Shah Tughluq are a prime example.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_74"><strong>Faulty Policies of Rulers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_75"><strong>Muhammad bin Tughluq:</strong> His chaotic projects (transfer of capital, token currency) bankrupted the treasury and caused widespread rebellion.</span> </li>
                        <li><span id="spap_76"><strong>Firoz Shah Tughluq:</strong> His policy of making the Iqta and army posts <strong>hereditary</strong> fatally weakened the Sultan's central control over the nobles and the military.</span> </li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_77"><strong>Disloyalty of Nobles (Iqtadars):</strong> The nobles constantly conspired against the Sultan and sought to establish their own independent kingdoms. The hereditary Iqta system only made this easier.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_78"><strong>Foreign Invasions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_79"><strong>Timur's Invasion (1398):</strong> This was the "death blow." It shattered the empire's power, wealth, and prestige, and led to the rise of many independent regional kingdoms.</span> </li>
                        <li><span id="spap_80"><strong>Babur's Invasion (1526):</strong> This was the final, decisive blow. Babur's victory at the <strong>First Battle of Panipat</strong> ended the Sultanate and established the Mughal Empire.</span> </li>
