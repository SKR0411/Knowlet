            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_56"><strong>Emergence:</strong> Like Vijayanagara, the Bahmani Sultanate was born from the chaos of Muhammad bin Tughluq's reign.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_57"><strong>Founder:</strong> It was founded in 1347 by <strong>Ala-ud-din Hasan Bahman Shah</strong> (Hasan Gangu). He was a rebel noble who established an independent Islamic kingdom in the Deccan.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_58"><strong>Capitals:</strong> The initial capital was <strong>Gulbarga</strong>, later shifted to <strong>Bidar</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_59"><strong>Key Figure: Mahmud Gawan</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_60">He was not a king, but a prime minister (<em>Wazir</em>) who served several Bahmani Sultans.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_61">He was a brilliant administrator and general who brought the kingdom to its peak of power and prosperity.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_62">He introduced land reforms, strengthened the army, and founded a great <strong>Madrasa (college)</strong> in Bidar.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_63">His success aroused the jealousy of other nobles (the <em>Deccanis</em> vs. the <em>Afaqis</em> or foreigners), who conspired against him and had him executed. His death marked the beginning of the end for the Bahmani kingdom.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>

            <h2 id="topic5"><span id="spap_70">5. Vijayanagara and Bahamani Relations</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_71">The relationship between these two neighboring empires was one of <strong>constant and intense warfare</strong>. The conflict lasted for their entire existence (almost 200 years).</span></p>
            
            <h3><span id="spap_72">Causes of Conflict:</span></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span id="spap_73"><strong>The Raichur Doab:</strong> This was the <strong>primary cause</strong>. The "Doab" was the fertile, resource-rich land between the <strong>Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers</strong>. Both kingdoms claimed it.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_74"><strong>Economic (Diamonds):</strong> The Krishna-Godavari delta region also had diamond mines, which both sides coveted.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_75"><strong>Political (Power):</strong> It was a straightforward struggle for political and military supremacy in the Deccan.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_76"><strong>Religious:</strong> While the kings often used religious rhetoric (Vijayanagara as "protector of Hindus" vs. Bahmani as "champion of Islam"), the main drivers were political and economic.</span></li>
            </ol>

            <h3><span id="spap_77">The Final Conflict: Battle of Talikota (1565)</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_78">After the Bahmani kingdom broke up, the <strong>five Deccan Sultanates</strong> continued the fight against Vijayanagara.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_79">In 1565, four of these Sultanates (Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Golkonda, and Bidar) formed a <strong>joint alliance</strong> to crush Vijayanagara.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_80">They met the Vijayanagara army at the <strong>Battle of Talikota</strong> (also known as Rakshasi-Tangadi).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_81"><strong>Result:</strong> The Vijayanagara army was completely defeated, and the king was killed.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_82"><strong>Sack of Vijayanagara:</strong> Following the battle, the victorious armies marched on the capital city of Vijayanagara (Hampi) and systematically <strong>destroyed and plundered it</strong> over several months.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_83"><strong>Consequence:</strong> The battle was a fatal blow. The great Vijayanagara Empire never recovered, and the magnificent city was left in ruins (the "ruins of Hampi" we see today).</span></li>
