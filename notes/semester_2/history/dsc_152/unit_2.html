            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_8">1. Conquests of Alauddin Khalji (1296-1316)</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_9">Alauddin Khalji, who came to power by assassinating his uncle Jalaluddin Khalji, was a ruthless and highly ambitious military imperialist. His conquests were vast, covering both North and South India.</span></p>

            <h3><span id="spap_10">Conquests in North India:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_11"><strong>Gujarat (1299):</strong> He captured the wealthy province of Gujarat. It was here that his general, Nusrat Khan, acquired the slave <strong>Malik Kafur</strong>, who would later lead his southern campaigns.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_12"><strong>Ranthambore (1301):</strong> A powerful Rajput fort, captured after a long siege.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>Chittor (1303):</strong> The famous siege of Chittor, where, according to legend (from Malik Muhammad Jayasi's <em>Padmavat</em>), he was driven by a desire to capture Rani Padmini. The Rajput women, including the queen, are said to have committed <em>Jauhar</em> (mass self-immolation).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Malwa & others (1305):</strong> He subsequently conquered other kingdoms like Malwa, Ujjain, and Mandu.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span id="spap_15">Conquests in South India (Deccan):</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_16">Alauddin was the <strong>first Sultan of Delhi</strong> to send armies into the Deccan.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_17">His southern campaigns were led by his general, <strong>Malik Kafur</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Objective:</strong> Unlike his northern conquests, his aim in the south was not to annex territory. His goal was <strong>wealth</strong> (plunder) and to make the southern kings his <strong>vassals</strong> (feudatories) who would pay him annual tribute.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_19"><strong>Major Campaigns:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_20"><strong>Devagiri:</strong> Defeated Ramachandra Deva (Yadava dynasty).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_21"><strong>Warangal:</strong> Defeated Prataparudra Deva (Kakatiya dynasty). This is where Kafur obtained the famous <strong>Koh-i-Noor diamond</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_22"><strong>Dwarasamudra:</strong> Defeated Vira Ballala III (Hoysala dynasty).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_23"><strong>Madurai:</strong> Raided the Pandya kingdom, acquiring immense treasure.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_24">2. Economic measures of Alauddin Khalji</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_25">To support his massive army (needed for conquests and to fight off Mongol invasions), Alauddin implemented revolutionary economic reforms. His goal was to control prices to keep his army's maintenance costs low.</span></p>

            <h3><span id="spap_26">Key Economic Measures:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_27"><strong>Market Control Policy (Price Fixation):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_28">He fixed the cost of all essential commodities, from grain and sugar to horses, slaves, and cloth.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_29">He set up three separate markets in Delhi: one for grains (<em>Mandi</em>), one for cloth and groceries (<em>Sarai-Adl</em>), and one for horses and slaves.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_30"><strong>Enforcement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_31">High-level officers, the <strong>Shahna-i-Mandi</strong> (Superintendent of the Market) and <strong>Diwan-i-Riyasat</strong> (Commerce Minister), were appointed to oversee the markets.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_32">A network of spies (<em>barids</em>) reported directly to him.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_33">Punishments for cheating were severe (e.g., a merchant who "under-weighed" would have an equal amount of flesh cut from his body).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_34"><strong>Revenue Reforms:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_35"><strong>Land Measurement:</strong> He was the first Sultan to order a systematic <strong>measurement of land</strong> (based on <em>biswa</em>) to assess tax.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_36"><strong>High Tax Rate:</strong> He raised the land tax (<em>Kharaj</em>) to <strong>50% of the produce</strong>, the maximum allowed.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_37"><strong>Abolition of Middlemen:</strong> He eliminated the traditional power of local chieftains (<em>Khuts, Muqaddams</em>) to collect taxes, weakening their power and increasing state revenue.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_38">He also imposed a grazing tax (<em>Charai</em>) and a house tax (<em>Ghari</em>).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic3"><span id="spap_39">3. Reforms of Muhammad Bin Tughluq (1325-1351)</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_40">Muhammad bin Tughluq (MBT) was a brilliant scholar, but his ambitious projects were far ahead of their time and poorly executed, leading to widespread failure and earning him a reputation as the "wise fool."</span></p>
            
            <h3><span id="spap_41">The Four Great "Reforms" (Failures):</span></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span id="spap_42"><strong>Taxation in the Doab (1326):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_43"><strong>What:</strong> He increased the land tax in the fertile Ganga-Yamuna Doab region.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_44"><strong>Why it Failed:</strong> The tax increase was too steep and, tragically, it was imposed during a <strong>severe famine</strong>. Peasants, unable to pay, abandoned their lands and fled, leading to a massive agrarian crisis.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_45"><strong>Transfer of Capital (1327):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_46"><strong>What:</strong> He ordered the capital to be shifted from <strong>Delhi</strong> to <strong>Daulatabad</strong> (Devagiri) in the Deccan.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_47"><strong>Why:</strong> He wanted a more centrally located capital to control his vast empire.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_48"><strong>Why it Failed:</strong> He didn't just move the government; he forced the <em>entire population</em> of Delhi to move. The 1,500 km journey was brutal, and many died. He later realized the move was impractical (as he couldn't control the north from the south) and ordered everyone back to Delhi.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_49"><strong>Token Currency (1329):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_50"><strong>What:</strong> He introduced a <strong>"token currency"</strong>, issuing coins of <strong>bronze</strong> and <strong>copper</strong> that were to have the same value as silver coins (<em>Tanka</em>).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_51"><strong>Why:</strong> There was a worldwide shortage of silver. The idea itself was sound (like modern paper money).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_52"><strong>Why it Failed:</strong> He failed to make the minting of coins a state monopoly. People began <strong>counterfeiting</strong> the new coins in their homes. Soon, the market was flooded with fake coins, foreign trade stopped, and the economy collapsed. He had to repeal the reform and exchange all the fake coins for real silver, emptying the treasury.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_53"><strong>Khurasan Expedition (1329-30):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_54"><strong>What:</strong> He raised a massive army (reportedly 370,000 men) to invade Khurasan (Persia).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_55"><strong>Why it Failed:</strong> He paid the army a full year's salary in advance. However, the political situation in Khurasan changed, and the expedition was abandoned. The disbanded, unemployed soldiers became a source of unrest.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ol>
            <div class="common-mistake">
                <span id="spap_56"><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Thinking Muhammad bin Tughluq was stupid. He wasn't. He was a visionary, but he lacked practical sense and patience. His ideas (central capital, token currency) were brilliant, but his execution was disastrous.</span>
            </div>

            <h2 id="topic4"><span id="spap_57">4. Contribution of Firoz Shah Tughluq (1351-1388)</span></h2> 
            <p><span id="spap_58">After the chaos of his cousin MBT, Firoz Shah Tughluq was a much quieter, more orthodox, and welfare-oriented ruler. His reign was one of peace and development, but also one that strengthened religious orthodoxy and had long-term administrative weaknesses.</span></p>

            <h3><span id="spap_59">Key Contributions:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_60"><strong>Public Works (The "Builder"):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_61"><strong>Canal System:</strong> His greatest achievement was building a vast network of <strong>canals</strong> for irrigation in the Haryana-Punjab region, leading to huge agricultural prosperity.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_62"><strong>New Cities:</strong> He was a prolific builder, founding cities like <strong>Firozabad</strong> (in Delhi), Jaunpur, Hisar, and Fatehabad.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_63">He also repaired old monuments like the Qutb Minar.</span></li>

                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_68"><strong>Religious Policy (Orthodoxy):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_69">He was a devout, orthodox Sunni Muslim. He tried to rule according to Islamic law (Sharia).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_70">He abolished many of the "un-Islamic" taxes of his predecessors, keeping only the four sanctioned by the Quran.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_71"><strong>Jizya:</strong> He imposed the <strong>Jizya</strong> (poll tax on non-Muslims) as a separate tax and even extended it to Brahmins, who had previously been exempt.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_72"><strong>Administrative "Weaknesses":</strong>

                        <li><span id="spap_73">To please the nobles, he revived the <strong>Iqta system</strong> and made it <strong>hereditary</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_74">He also made military positions hereditary. This move weakened the central authority and the army, contributing to the Sultanate's decline after his death.</span></li>
