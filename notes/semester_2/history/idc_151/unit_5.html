            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_11">a) Women Organisations in India</span> </h2>
            <p><span id="spap_12">The participation of women in the freedom movement, combined with the spread of education, led to the formation of the first major, all-India women's organizations. These groups were founded by and for women, to fight for their political and social rights.</span></p>

            <h3 id="topic1a"><span id="spap_13">1. Women's Indian Association (WIA)</span> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Founded:</strong> 1917 in Adyar, Madras (Chennai).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>Founders:</strong> Key founders included <strong>Annie Besant</strong>, <strong>Margaret Cousins</strong>, and <strong>Dorothy Jinarajadasa</strong>. They were primarily European theosophists who inspired Indian women to organize.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_16"><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> To secure <strong>women's suffrage</strong> (the right to vote).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Achievements:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_18">It was the first organization to take the demand for women's votes to the British government.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_19">In 1917, they led a delegation (along with Sarojini Naidu) to Lord Montagu to demand political rights for women in the upcoming reforms.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_20">They successfully campaigned for the vote, which was granted piecemeal (province by province) starting in 1921.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="topic1b"><span id="spap_21">2. National Council of Women in India (NCWI)</span> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_22"><strong>Founded:</strong> 1925, as a branch of the International Council of Women.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_23"><strong>Founders:</strong> Led by elite, aristocratic women like <strong>Lady Meherbai Tata</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_24"><strong>Nature:</strong> This was a more "establishment" and less radical organization. It was not a mass-based group like the AIWC.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_25"><strong>Goal:</strong> It focused on "women's issues" from a position of social welfare and cooperation with the government, rather than direct political confrontation. They worked on issues like health, maternity, and trafficking.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="topic1c"><span id="spap_26">3. All India Women's Conference (AIWC)</span> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_27"><strong>Founded:</strong> 1927 in Pune.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_28"><strong>Founders:</strong> Started by <strong>Margaret Cousins</strong> as a non-political gathering to discuss <strong>educational reform</strong> for women.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_29"><strong>Nature:</strong> It quickly grew into the largest and most important women's organization in India, with branches all over the country. It was led by prominent Indian women like <strong>Maharani Chimnabai Gaekwad</strong>, <strong>Sarojini Naidu</strong>, and <strong>Kamala Devi Chattopadhyay</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_30"><strong>Evolution:</strong> It famously began with the slogan, "First educate the women, and the vote will follow."
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_31"><strong>Phase 1 (Education):</strong> Its initial focus was purely on education.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_32"><strong>Phase 2 (Social & Legal Reform):</strong> It quickly realized education was impossible without tackling social evils. It became the main lobbying force for:
                            <ul>
                                <li><span id="spap_33">The <strong>Sarda Act (1929)</strong> to raise the age of marriage.</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_34">Laws giving women rights to inheritance and divorce.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_35"><strong>Phase 3 (Political):</strong> By the 1930s, it abandoned its "non-political" stance and became deeply involved in the freedom movement, demanding universal adult franchise (voting rights for all).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_36"><strong>Significance:</strong> The AIWC was the "mother" of the Indian women's movement, uniting women from diverse backgrounds for a common cause.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_37">b) Women and Law</span> </h2>
            <p><span id="spap_38">After independence, the Indian Constitution (1950) granted women full equality (Art. 14) and prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex (Art. 15). However, social realities remained harsh. The post-independence women's movement has focused on translating this legal equality into reality by fighting for specific laws.</span></p>

            <h3 id="topic2a"><span id="spap_39">1. Acts Prohibiting Domestic Violence</span> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_40"><strong>The Problem:</strong> For decades, violence within the home ("domestic violence") was seen as a private, "family matter," not a crime. Police would not interfere.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_41"><strong>Early Law (Section 498A):</strong> In 1983, a new section (498A) was added to the Indian Penal Code. This was the first law that recognized "cruelty by a husband or his relatives" (often linked to dowry) as a specific <strong>criminal offense</strong>, punishable with imprisonment.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_42"><strong>The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_43">This was a landmark, revolutionary law because it was a <strong>civil law</strong>, not a criminal one.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_44"><strong>Broader Definition:</strong> It recognized that domestic violence is not just physical. It provided a broad definition of violence, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li><span id="spap_45"><strong>Physical</strong> abuse</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_46"><strong>Sexual</strong> abuse</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_47"><strong>Verbal/Emotional</strong> abuse (insults, humiliation)</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_48"><strong>Economic</strong> abuse (not providing money, taking her salary)</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_49"><strong>Focus on Rights, not just Jail:</strong> Its main goal is to provide <strong>immediate relief</strong> to the victim, not just to punish the abuser. A woman can get court orders for:
                            <ul>
                                <li><span id="spap_50"><strong>Protection:</strong> An order to stop the abuser from committing violence.</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_51"><strong>Residence:</strong> The right to live in her marital home (the "shared household"), and the abuser can be ordered to leave.</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_52"><strong>Monetary Relief & Custody:</strong> Orders for maintenance and temporary custody of children.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="topic2b"><span id="spap_53">2. Dowry Prohibition Act (1961)</span> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_54"><strong>The Problem:</strong> The practice of dowry (a payment in cash or kind from the bride's family to the groom's) was leading to the harassment, torture, and "dowry death" (often disguised as "kitchen accidents") of young brides.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_55"><strong>The Act (1961):</strong> This was the first major social legislation after independence.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_56">It made the act of <strong>giving, taking, or demanding</strong> dowry a criminal offense.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_57"><strong>Failure and Amendments:</strong> The original act was weak and ineffective. It was very difficult to prove that a "gift" was actually "dowry."
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_58">Following massive protests by women's groups in the 1980s (a period of many "dowry deaths"), the act was <strong>amended in 1984 and 1986</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_59">The amendments made the law much stricter:
                            <ul>
                                <li><span id="spap_60">They introduced <strong>Section 498A</strong> (discussed above) for "dowry harassment."</span></li>
                                <li><span id="spap_61">They created a new offense, <strong>Section 304B</strong> ("Dowry Death"), which states that if a woman dies of unnatural causes (e.g., burns) within 7 years of marriage, and had been harassed for dowry, the husband is *presumed* guilty, and the burden of proof is on him to prove his innocence.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </span></li>
                    </ul>
