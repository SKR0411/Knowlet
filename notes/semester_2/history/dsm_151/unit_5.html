            <p><span id="spap_9"><strong>Harsha Vardhana</strong> (c. 606-647 CE) was the last great emperor of ancient India. He belonged to the <strong>Pushyabhuti dynasty</strong> of Thanesar.</span></p>
            
            <h3><span id="spap_10">Accession and Conquests:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_11">Harsha ascended the throne at age 16 under tragic circumstances. His brother-in-law, Grahavarman (King of Kanauj), was killed by the king of Malwa. His elder brother, Rajyavardhana, was then treacherously murdered by <strong>Sashanka</strong>, the king of Gauda (Bengal).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_12">Harsha's first acts were to rescue his sister Rajyashri and consolidate his power.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>Unification:</strong> He merged his own kingdom of Thanesar with the Maukhari kingdom of Kanauj and made <strong>Kanauj</strong> his new, magnificent capital.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Conquests:</strong> He spent over 30 years in continuous warfare, bringing most of North India (from Punjab to Bengal) under his control. He earned the title <strong>'Sakalottarapathanatha'</strong> (Lord of all of North India).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>His Southern Limit:</strong> Harsha's ambition to conquer the Deccan was famously checked. He was defeated on the banks of the Narmada River by the Chalukyan King, <strong>Pulakesin II</strong>. This battle is a key event, mentioned in Pulakesin's Aihole Inscription.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><span id="spap_16">Administration:</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Feudal and Decentralized:</strong> Unlike the Mauryas, Harsha's administration was more <strong>feudal and decentralized</strong>. He ruled through a large number of feudatory chiefs (<em>Samantas</em>) who paid him tribute and provided military support.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Personal Inspection:</strong> Harsha was a hands-on ruler. He constantly toured his empire to personally supervise the administration.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_19"><strong>Revenue:</strong> The state revenue was divided into four parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li><span id="spap_20">For government expenses.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_21">For salaries of public officials (often paid in land grants).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_22">For rewarding scholars and intellectuals.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_23">For charity to various religious sects.</span></li>
                    </ol>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_24">2. Cultural Contribution of Harsha</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_25">Harsha was a great patron of arts and learning, earning him the title of "Harsha Vikramaditya."</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_26"><strong>Harsha the Author:</strong> Harsha was an accomplished playwright himself. He is credited with writing three famous Sanskrit plays:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_27"><strong>Priyadarshika</strong></span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_28"><strong>Ratnavali</strong></span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_29"><strong>Nagananda</strong> (a Buddhist-themed play)</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_30"><strong>Patron of Scholars:</strong> His court was home to the great Sanskrit poet <strong>Banabhatta</strong>, who wrote the <strong>Harshacharita</strong> (a biography of Harsha) and <em>Kadambari</em>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_31"><strong>Patron of Buddhism:</strong> Though he was tolerant of all faiths (a Shaivite early in life), Harsha became a great patron of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_32"><strong>Kanauj Assembly:</strong> He organized a grand assembly at Kanauj to honor the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang and to promote the Mahayana faith.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_33"><strong>Maha Moksha Parishad (Prayag):</strong> Every five years, he held a great assembly at Prayag (Allahabad) at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. Here, he would famously donate <em>all</em> the wealth from his treasury to scholars and ascetics of all religions, to the point of giving away his own robes and jewels.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic3"><span id="spap_34">3. Gauda Under Sashanka</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_35"><strong>Sashanka</strong> (c. late 6th - 7th century) was the powerful and ambitious king of <strong>Gauda</strong> (a kingdom in modern-day Bengal).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_36">He was a contemporary and the <strong>arch-rival of Harsha Vardhana</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_37"><strong>Role in Harsha's Rise:</strong> Sashanka was directly responsible for the crisis that brought Harsha to power. He allied with the king of Malwa, murdered Harsha's brother-in-law (Grahavarman), and then treacherously killed Harsha's elder brother (Rajyavardhana).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_38"><strong>Religious Policy:</strong> Sashanka was a fierce devotee of <strong>Shiva (Shaivism)</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_39"><strong>Persecutor of Buddhism:</strong> He is infamous in Buddhist records (especially in Hiuen Tsang's account) as a virulent persecutor of Buddhism. He is accused of:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_40">Destroying Buddhist monasteries and stupas.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_41">Cutting down the <strong>Bodhi Tree</strong> at Bodh Gaya, under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_42">Harsha's early campaigns were directed against Sashanka, but Sashanka remained a powerful check on Harsha's eastern ambitions for most of his life.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic4"><span id="spap_43">4. Account of Hiuen Tsang (Xuanzang)</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_44"><strong>Hiuen Tsang</strong> (also known as Xuanzang) was the most famous and influential of all Chinese Buddhist pilgrims. His journey and his writings are a priceless source of information for this period.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_45"><strong>Purpose of Visit:</strong> He was a Buddhist monk who undertook the dangerous 15-year journey (c. 630-645 CE) to India to visit the Buddhist holy sites and, most importantly, to collect authentic Buddhist scriptures to take back to China.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_46"><strong>His Book:</strong> He wrote a detailed travelogue called <strong>'Si-Yu-Ki'</strong> (or 'Record of the Western World').</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_47"><strong>His Account of India:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_48"><strong>On Harsha:</strong> He was a personal guest of Harsha and was the guest of honor at the Kanauj and Prayag assemblies. He provides a glowing, firsthand account of Harsha's generosity, his administrative tours, and his patronage of Buddhism.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_49"><strong>On Nalanda:</strong> Hiuen Tsang studied at <strong>Nalanda University</strong> for several years. He gives a vivid description of life at the university—its curriculum, its thousands of students and teachers, its strict discipline, and its vast library.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_50"><strong>On Society:</strong> He provides a mixed picture. He praises the gentle nature of the people and the light taxes, but also notes the rigidity of the <strong>caste system</strong>, the existence of "untouchables," and the dangers of travel (he was robbed by bandits).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_51"><strong>On Religion:</strong> He gives a clear picture of the religious landscape, noting the co-existence of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, but also observing that Buddhism was in decline in many parts of India, while Hinduism was flourishing.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <span id="spap_52"><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> The two key sources for this unit are <strong>Banabhatta's 'Harshacharita'</strong> (an insider's courtly biography) and <strong>Hiuen Tsang's 'Si-Yu-Ki'</strong> (a foreigner's detailed observation). Be ready to compare what they tell us about Harsha's reign.</span>
