            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_8">1. Kanishka-conquests & achievements</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_9">Kanishka I (c. 127–150 CE) was the greatest ruler of the <strong>Kushana dynasty</strong>, a Yuezhi tribe from Central Asia. He ruled a vast empire that was a true bridge between East and West.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_10"><strong>Conquests & Empire:</strong> His empire extended from Central Asia (parts of modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan) and Bactria (Afghanistan) down into the Indian subcontinent, covering most of Northern India.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_11">He had two main capitals: <strong>Purushapura</strong> (Peshawar) in the west and <strong>Mathura</strong> in the east.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_12">He controlled the <strong>Silk Road</strong>, which was a major source of his empire's wealth.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>Start of the Saka Era:</strong> His ascension to the throne in <strong>78 CE</strong> is believed to mark the beginning of the <strong>Saka Era</strong>, which is still used as the official civil calendar by the Government of India.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Patronage of Buddhism:</strong> Kanishka's most significant achievement was his patronage of <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_15">He convened the <strong>Fourth Buddhist Council</strong> in Kashmir.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_16">This council was a turning point: it finalized the doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism and saw Buddhist texts being compiled in <strong>Sanskrit</strong> for the first time, instead of Pali.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Patronage of Scholars:</strong> His court included many scholars, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Ashvaghosha:</strong> A poet and philosopher who wrote the <em>Buddhacharita</em> (biography of the Buddha).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_19"><strong>Charaka:</strong> The "Father of Indian Medicine," who compiled the <em>Charaka Samhita</em>, a foundational text of Ayurveda.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_20">2. Art & culture during the Kushana period</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_21">The Kushana period was a golden age for art, marked by the emergence of two distinct schools of sculpture. This was the first time the Buddha was depicted in human form.</span></p>

            <h3><span id="spap_22">Gandhara School of Art</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_23"><strong>Location:</strong> Northwest India (Gandhara region, e.g., Taxila, Peshawar).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_24"><strong>Patronage:</strong> Kushanas.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_25"><strong>Influence:</strong> Heavily influenced by <strong>Greco-Roman (Hellenistic)</strong> art styles. It is often called "Greco-Buddhist" art.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_26"><strong>Key Features:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_27"><strong>Buddha's Appearance:</strong> The Buddha is depicted realistically, resembling a <strong>Greek god like Apollo</strong>.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_28">Features include wavy or curly hair (like a Greek), a muscular body, and draped, toga-like robes.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_29">The focus is on anatomical perfection and outward beauty.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_30"><strong>Material:</strong> Grey or blue schist stone.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-placeholder"><span id="spap_31"></span><br><span id="spap_32">Image: Gandhara School Buddha (noting Greek features)</span></div>

            <h3><span id="spap_33">Mathura School of Art</span></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_34"><strong>Location:</strong> Mathura (on the Yamuna River).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_35"><strong>Patronage:</strong> Kushanas.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_36"><strong>Influence:</strong> Purely <strong>indigenous</strong> (Indian), based on local folk art like the *Yaksha* figures.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_37"><strong>Key Features:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_38"><strong>Buddha's Appearance:</strong> The Buddha is depicted with a fleshy, powerful body, a shaven head (or small snail-shell curls), a smiling face, and a sense of inner spiritual energy.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_39">The focus is on spiritual essence rather than physical realism.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_40">This school also produced the first images of <strong>Jain Tirthankaras</strong> and <strong>Hindu gods</strong> (like Vishnu and Shiva).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_41"><strong>Material:</strong> Red spotted sandstone.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-placeholder"><span id="spap_42"></span><br><span id="spap_43">Image: Mathura School Buddha (noting indigenous features)</span></div>

            <h2 id="topic3"><span id="spap_44">3. Western Kshatrapas: Rudradaman</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_45">The Western Kshatrapas (or Sakas) were rulers of Scythian (Saka) origin who controlled a large part of western and central India (Gujarat, Malwa, Sind).</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_46"><strong>Rudradaman I (c. 130–150 CE):</strong> He was the greatest ruler of this dynasty. He was a contemporary of the Satavahanas (and their main rival).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_47"><strong>Primary Source:</strong> His achievements are famously recorded in the <strong>Junagadh (or Girnar) Rock Inscription</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_48"><strong>Significance of the Inscription:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_49">It is the <strong>first-ever long inscription written in chaste Sanskrit</strong> in India (previous ones, like Ashoka's, were in Prakrit).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_50">It is a "prashasti" (eulogy) detailing his achievements.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_51"><strong>Key Achievements (from the inscription):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_52"><strong>Military:</strong> He defeated the Satavahanas (Gautamiputra's son, Vasisthiputra Pulumavi) twice but did not destroy them due to a family relationship (his daughter was married to the Satavahana king).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_53"><strong>Public Works:</strong> His most famous act was repairing the <strong>Sudarshana Lake</strong> (a reservoir first built by the Mauryas). The inscription proudly states he did this "without oppressing the people with forced labor (<em>vishti</em>) or new taxes."</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic4"><span id="spap_54">4. Kalinga ruler: Kharavela</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_55">Kharavela was the powerful king of the <strong>Chedi dynasty</strong>, which ruled over <strong>Kalinga</strong> (modern-day Odisha) in the 1st or 2nd century BCE. He is one of the most important figures in post-Mauryan history.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_56"><strong>Primary Source:</strong> Our *only* source of information about him is the <strong>Hathigumpha (Elephant Cave) Inscription</strong> at Udayagiri, near Bhubaneswar.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_57"><strong>The Inscription:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_58">It is written in Prakrit, in the Brahmi script.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_59">It provides a unique, year-by-year (annalistic) account of the first 13 years of his reign.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_60"><strong>Key Achievements (from the inscription):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_61"><strong>Patron of Jainism:</strong> He was a devout Jain. The inscription begins with a Jain prayer. He patronized Jain monks and built caves for them.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_62"><strong>Military Campaigns:</strong> He was a great conqueror. The inscription mentions his campaigns against the Satavahanas in the west, and against the Pandyas in the far south.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_63"><strong>Revenge on Magadha:</strong> His most famous campaign was against Magadha (the old Mauryan capital). He is said to have defeated the king of Magadha and brought back the Jain idol that had been taken by the Mauryas.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_64"><strong>Public Works:</strong> He built canals (expanding on one built by the Nandas), roads, and entertainment centers for his people.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
