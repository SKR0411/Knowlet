            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_8">1. Shungas: Pushyamitra (c. 185 BCE)</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_9">The Shunga dynasty was established in 185 BCE, marking the end of the Mauryan Empire.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_10"><strong>Foundation:</strong> The founder was <strong>Pushyamitra Shunga</strong>. He was the commander-in-chief (<em>Senapati</em>) of the last Mauryan king, <strong>Brihadratha</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_11"><strong>The Coup:</strong> Pushyamitra assassinated Brihadratha in a public military parade and seized the throne of Magadha. This event is often called the "Brahminical Revolution" as Pushyamitra was a Brahmin, replacing the Buddhist-leaning Mauryas.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_12"><strong>Political Achievements:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>Consolidation:</strong> He consolidated his rule over the central Mauryan territories.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Defense against Indo-Greeks:</strong> His most significant military achievement was successfully defending Magadha against the invasions of the Indo-Greeks (Yavanas), possibly led by Menander or Demetrius.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>Ashvamedha Yajna:</strong> To celebrate his victories and legitimize his rule as a new "Chakravartin" (universal ruler), Pushyamitra performed two <em>Ashvamedha</em> (horse sacrifices), a traditional Vedic ritual.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_16"><strong>Stance on Buddhism:</strong> This is a debated topic.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_17">Some Buddhist texts (like the <em>Divyavadana</em>) portray him as a cruel persecutor of Buddhists.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_18">However, archaeological evidence shows that great Buddhist monuments like the <strong>Sanchi Stupa</strong> and the <strong>Bharhut Stupa</strong> were expanded and renovated during the Shunga period, suggesting some level of patronage or tolerance.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_19">2. Political achievement of Gautamiputra Satakarni</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_20">Gautamiputra Satakarni (c. 1st - 2nd Century CE) was the <strong>greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty</strong>, which ruled in the Deccan.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_21"><strong>Primary Source:</strong> His achievements are recorded in detail in the <strong>Nashik Prashasti (Inscription)</strong>, which was composed by his mother, <strong>Gautami Balasri</strong>, after his death.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_22"><strong>Revival of Satavahana Power:</strong> He is credited with reviving the power of his dynasty, which had been eclipsed by the Western Kshatrapas (Sakas).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_23"><strong>Greatest Military Victory:</strong> His most celebrated achievement was the complete defeat of the Saka ruler <strong>Nahapana</strong>. This is confirmed by a hoard of Nahapana's coins that were "restruck" (stamped over) with Gautamiputra's own symbols.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_24"><strong>Titles:</strong> The Nashik inscription gives him lofty titles, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_25"><strong>"Destroyer of the Sakas, Yavanas (Greeks), and Pahlavas (Parthians)."</strong></span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_26"><strong>"Lord of the Southern Sea"</strong> (Trisamudra-toya-pita-vahana), indicating his naval power.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_27">"The only Brahmin," highlighting his role as a protector of the Varna system.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_28">His empire extended over the entire Deccan, from the Krishna River in the south to the Narmada in the north.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic3"><span id="spap_29">3. Satavahana Administration</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_30">The Satavahana administrative system was a blend of Mauryan structures and local Deccan traditions, laying the groundwork for later southern kingdoms.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_31"><strong>Mauryan Influence:</strong> Like the Mauryas, the kingdom was divided into provinces called <strong>'Aharas'</strong> (similar to Mauryan 'districts'), which were governed by officials called <strong>'Amatyas'</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_32"><strong>Military Character:</strong> The administration had a strong military character. Local administrators, called *'Gaulmikas'*, were often in charge of a *'Gulma'* (a military regiment) and were responsible for both police and military functions in rural areas.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_33"><strong>Feudal Elements:</strong> The Satavahanas were the <strong>first Indian rulers to make land grants</strong> (Brahmadeya) to Brahmins and Buddhist monks. This is a very important development, as it created a class of landholders independent of the king, which is seen as an early step towards feudalism.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_34"><strong>Matronymics:</strong> A unique feature was the use of matronymics (names derived from the mother), such as <em>Gautamiputra</em> ("Son of Gautami") and <em>Vasisthiputra</em> ("Son of Vasisthi"). This indicates the high status of women, although the succession to the throne remained patrilineal (father to son).</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic4"><span id="spap_35">4. Indo-Greeks: Menander</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_36">Following the decline of the Mauryan Empire, Greek rulers from Bactria (in modern-day Afghanistan) invaded Northwest India. These are known as the Indo-Greeks.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_37"><strong>King Menander (Milinda):</strong> The most famous and powerful Indo-Greek king (c. 165 BCE - 130 BCE).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_38"><strong>Capital:</strong> He ruled from his capital at <strong>Sakala</strong> (modern Sialkot in Pakistan).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_39"><strong>Military Campaigns:</strong> He led invasions deep into the Gangetic plains, perhaps even reaching Pataliputra, where he was repelled by Pushyamitra Shunga.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_40"><strong>Conversion to Buddhism:</strong> Menander's most lasting legacy is in religious history. He converted to Buddhism after a long philosophical debate with a Buddhist sage named <strong>Nagasena</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_41"><strong>The 'Milinda Panha':</strong> This famous conversion is recorded in the Pali Buddhist text, <strong>"Milinda Panha"</strong> (The Questions of Milinda). The book is a masterpiece of philosophical inquiry, where King Milinda asks questions about Buddhist doctrine, and Nagasena provides clear, logical answers.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_42"><strong>Coinage:</strong> The Indo-Greeks, especially Menander, introduced advanced coinage (numismatics) to India. They were the first to issue coins with:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_43">Realistic portraits of the king.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_44">Bilingual inscriptions (in Greek on one side and Prakrit/Kharosthi on the other).</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <span id="spap_45"><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be prepared to answer short questions on key texts and inscriptions.
                <ul>
                    <li><span id="spap_46"><strong>Milinda Panha:</strong> The dialogue between King Menander and Nagasena.</span></li>
                    <li><span id="spap_47"><strong>Nashik Prashasti:</strong> The inscription detailing the achievements of Gautamiputra Satakarni.</span></li>
                </ul></span>
