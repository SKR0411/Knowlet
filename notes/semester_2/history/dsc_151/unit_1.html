            <h2 id="topic1"><span id="spap_11">1. Chalukyas</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_12">The Chalukyas were a prominent dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. This unit focuses on the <strong>Chalukyas of Badami</strong> (or Vatapi), the earliest branch, who rose to power in the Deccan.</span></p>

            <h3 id="topic1a"><span id="spap_13">1.a) Political achievements - Pulakesin II</span></h3> 
            <p><span id="spap_14"><strong>Pulakesin II</strong> (c. 610–642 CE) was the most celebrated ruler of the Chalukya dynasty. His reign is a high point in the history of the Deccan.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>Primary Source:</strong> Our main source of information for his reign is the <strong>Aihole Inscription</strong>, a Sanskrit eulogy composed by his court poet, Ravikirti.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_16"><strong>Consolidation of Power:</strong> He ascended the throne after a civil war, defeating his uncle Mangalesha. He quickly consolidated his control over the Chalukyan heartland.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Victory over Harsha:</strong> His most famous achievement was the defeat of <strong>Harshavardhana</strong> of Kanauj, the dominant ruler of North India. Pulakesin II stopped Harsha's southward expansion on the banks of the Narmada River. This victory established the Narmada as the boundary between the northern and southern empires and earned him the title <em>Parameshwara</em> ("Supreme Lord").</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Other Conquests:</strong> He subdued the Kadambas of Banavasi, the Gangas of Mysore, and the Alupas of South Canara. His empire stretched from coast to coast.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_19"><strong>Conflict with Pallavas:</strong> He waged a long war against the Pallavas of Kanchi. He successfully defeated the Pallava king <strong>Mahendravarman I</strong>.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_20"><strong>His Defeat:</strong> However, the Pallavas, under <strong>Narasimhavarman I</strong> (son of Mahendravarman I), regrouped. Narasimhavarman I invaded the Chalukya kingdom, defeated Pulakesin II, and captured the capital, Badami, in c. 642 CE. Pulakesin II was likely killed in this conflict.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <span id="spap_21"><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> The question on <strong>"Pulakesin II's victory over Harshavardhana"</strong> is a very common short-answer or long-answer question. Always mention the Aihole inscription and the Narmada River as the boundary.</span>
            </div>

            <h3 id="topic1b"><span id="spap_22">1.b) Cultural Achievements</span></h3> 
            <p><span id="spap_23">The Chalukyas of Badami are most famous for their contributions to art and architecture. They were pioneers of a new style of temple architecture.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_24"><strong>Temple Architecture:</strong> They are credited with developing the <strong>Chalukyan or Vesara style</strong> of architecture, which skillfully combines elements from the northern <em>Nagara</em> style and the southern <em>Dravida</em> style.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_25"><strong>Cradle of Indian Architecture:</strong> The Chalukyan capital cities served as experimental grounds for temple building.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_26"><strong>Aihole:</strong> Known as the "Cradle of Indian Temple Architecture," it has over 100 temples. Key examples include the <strong>Lad Khan Temple</strong>, <strong>Durga Temple</strong> (with its unique apsidal plan), and Huchimalli Gudi.</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_27"><strong>Badami (Vatapi):</strong> Famous for its four magnificent <strong>rock-cut cave temples</strong>. Three are dedicated to Hindu gods (Shiva and Vishnu) and one is a Jain temple. These caves are known for their beautiful sculptures, including the <em>Nataraja</em> (dancing Shiva).</span></li>
                        <li><span id="spap_28"><strong>Pattadakal:</strong> A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this is where the Chalukyan style reached its zenith. It features temples in *both* Nagara and Dravida styles, built side-by-side. The <strong>Virupaksha Temple</strong> (Dravida style) and the <strong>Papanatha Temple</strong> (Nagara style) are the most important.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_29"><strong>Painting:</strong> Fragments of beautiful murals can be found in the Badami cave temples, showing the advancement of painting during this period.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_30"><strong>Religion:</strong> The Chalukyas were patrons of Hinduism (both Shaivism and Vaishnavism) but were tolerant towards Jainism and Buddhism. Ravikirti, the court poet of Pulakesin II, was a Jain.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic2"><span id="spap_33">2. Rashtrakutas</span></h2>
            <p><span id="spap_34">The Rashtrakutas (c. 753–982 CE) succeeded the Chalukyas of Badami as the dominant power in the Deccan. They established their capital at <strong>Manyakheta</strong> (modern Malkhed). They were one of the "three powers" involved in the Tripartite Struggle.</span></p>

            <h3 id="topic2a"><span id="spap_35">2.a) Political history</span></h3> 
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_36"><strong>Dantidurga:</strong> The founder of the dynasty. He was a feudatory of the Chalukyas who overthrew his Chalukyan overlord, Kirtivarman II. He performed the <em>Hiranya-garbha</em> ("golden womb") ceremony to legitimize his status as a Kshatriya ruler.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_37"><strong>Krishna I:</strong> Succeeded Dantidurga. He is most famous for commissioning the <strong>Kailasa Temple at Ellora</strong>, a monolithic marvel.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_38"><strong>Dhruva:</strong> A great military general. He was the first Rashtrakuta king to intervene in North Indian politics, defeating both the Pratiharas and the Palas, thus beginning the <strong>Tripartite Struggle</strong>  for Kanauj.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_39"><strong>Amoghavarsha I:</strong> Reigned for 64 years, one of the longest in Indian history. He was more a patron of arts and literature than a military conqueror. He himself was an author, credited with writing <strong>'Kavirajamarga'</strong>, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics. He also built the capital city of Manyakheta.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_40"><strong>Indra III & Krishna III:</strong> Later powerful rulers who revived the empire's military glory. Krishna III was the last great Rashtrakuta ruler.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="topic2b"><span id="spap_41">2.b) Cultural Contribution</span></h3> 
            <p><span id="spap_42">The Rashtrakutas were great patrons of art, architecture, and literature.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_43"><strong>Architecture & Sculpture (Ellora):</strong> Their greatest contribution is the rock-cut caves at <strong>Ellora</strong> (a UNESCO World Heritage Site).
                    <ul>
                        <li><span id="spap_44"><strong>Kailasa Temple (Cave 16):</strong> This is the crowning achievement. It is a massive temple dedicated to Shiva, <strong>carved from a single, solid rock</strong> (monolithic). It was built by Krishna I and is considered one of the wonders of the ancient world.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_45"><strong>Elephanta Caves:</strong> The magnificent rock-cut caves at Elephanta, near Mumbai, are also attributed to the Rashtrakuta period. The <em>Trimurti</em> (three-faced Shiva) sculpture is world-famous.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_46"><strong>Literature:</strong> They patronized Sanskrit, Prakrit, and especially <strong>Kannada</strong>. As mentioned, Amoghavarsha I's <em>Kavirajamarga</em> was a milestone for Kannada literature.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_47"><strong>Religious Tolerance:</strong> The Rashtrakuta rulers were remarkably tolerant. While they were personally Hindus (mostly Shaivites), they equally patronized Jainism and Buddhism. Many Jain scholars and temples flourished under their rule.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-placeholder"><span id="spap_48"></span><br><span id="spap_49">Diagram: Kailasa Temple at Ellora</span></div>

            <h3 id="topic2c"><span id="spap_50">2.c) Administration</span></h3> 
            <p><span id="spap_51">The Rashtrakuta administration was based on the models of the Guptas and Chalukyas, but with its own distinct features.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="spap_52"><strong>Central Administration:</strong> The king was the supreme head, assisted by a council of ministers.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_53"><strong>Provincial Administration:</strong> The empire was divided into provinces called <strong>'Rashtras'</strong> (hence the name Rashtrakuta, meaning "head of the Rashtra"). These were governed by officials called <strong>'Rashtrapatis'</strong>, who were often from the royal family.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_54"><strong>Further Divisions:</strong> Rashtras were divided into <strong>'Vishayas'</strong> (districts) under <em>Vishayapatis</em>, and further into <strong>'Bhuktis'</strong> (smaller units).</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_55"><strong>Village Administration:</strong> The lowest unit was the village, headed by a <strong>'Gramapati'</strong> or <em>Prabhu</em>. He was assisted by a village assembly (<em>grama-mahasabha</em>) which played a significant role in local governance.</span></li>
                <li><span id="spap_56"><strong>Feudal Structure:</strong> The system was semi-feudal. Many feudatory chiefs (<em>Samantas</em>) ruled parts of the empire, paid tribute to the king, and provided military support.</span></li>
            </ul>
