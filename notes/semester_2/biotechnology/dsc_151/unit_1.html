        <h2 id="amino-acids">1. Amino Acids: Structure and Properties</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_1"><strong>Amino acids</strong> are the fundamental building blocks (monomers) of proteins.</span> Each amino acid has a central carbon atom, called the <strong>alpha-carbon (α-carbon)</strong>, which is bonded to four different groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An <strong>amino group</strong> (—NH₂)</li>
            <li>A <strong>carboxyl group</strong> (—COOH)</li>
            <li>A <strong>hydrogen atom</strong> (—H)</li>
            <li>A variable <strong>side chain</strong> or <strong>R-group</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <center>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gYj9gqj.png" alt="General Structure of an L-Amino Acid" style="width:50%;">
            <p><em>General Structure of an Amino Acid. The R-group determines its properties.</em></p>
        </center>

        <h3>Properties of Amino Acids</h3>
        
        <h4>a) Zwitterions and Amphoteric Nature</h4>
        <p>At physiological pH (~7.4), the amino group is protonated (—NH₃⁺) and the carboxyl group is deprotonated (—COO⁻). This molecule with both positive and negative charges is called a <strong>zwitterion</strong> (German for "hybrid ion").</p>
        <p>Because they can act as both an acid (donate H⁺) and a base (accept H⁺), amino acids are <strong>amphoteric</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4>b) Isoelectric Point (pI)</h4>
        <p>The <strong>isoelectric point (pI)</strong> is the specific pH at which an amino acid has no net electrical charge (i.e., it exists as a zwitterion). At a pH below its pI, it has a net positive charge. At a pH above its pI, it has a net negative charge.</p>
        
        <h4>c) Stereoisomerism</h4>
        <p>With the exception of <strong>glycine</strong> (whose R-group is just H), the α-carbon of all amino acids is chiral. This means they can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images: <strong>L-isomers</strong> and <strong>D-isomers</strong>. Biologically, <span id="spap_2">all amino acids found in proteins are of the <strong>L-configuration</strong></span>.</p>

        <h3>Classification of Amino Acids (Based on R-Group)</h3>
        <p>There are 20 standard amino acids, which are classified by the properties of their R-groups:</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be able to draw the general structure of an amino acid and classify at least one example from each of the 5 main groups. Remember that Proline is unique because its R-group forms a ring with its own amino group.

        <h2 id="protein-properties">2. Physical and Chemical Properties of Proteins</h2>
        <p>Proteins are polymers of amino acids linked by <strong>peptide bonds</strong>. Their properties are determined by their amino acid composition and 3D structure.</p>

        <h3>a) Physical Properties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solubility:</strong> Varies greatly. Globular proteins are generally soluble in water. Fibrous proteins are insoluble. Solubility is influenced by pH and salt concentration.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Salting In:</strong> At low salt concentrations, solubility increases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salting Out:</strong> At high salt concentrations, water molecules are competed for, and the protein precipitates. This is used in purification.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Denaturation:</strong> The loss of a protein's native 3D structure (secondary, tertiary, and quaternary), leading to a loss of function. This is often irreversible.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agents:</strong> Heat, extreme pH, organic solvents (e.g., alcohol), heavy metals, and detergents (e.g., SDS).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Isoelectric Point (pI):</strong> Just like amino acids, proteins have a pI. At this pH, the protein has no net charge and is least soluble, often leading to precipitation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>b) Chemical Properties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peptide Bond Formation:</strong> Formed by a <strong>dehydration (condensation) reaction</strong> between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrolysis:</strong> Peptide bonds can be broken by hydrolysis (adding water), a reaction catalyzed by acids, bases, or enzymes (proteases).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="protein-structure">3. Different Levels of Structural Organization of Proteins</h2>
        <p>This is a fundamental concept. Protein structure is described at four distinct levels.</p>

        <h3 id="primary-structure">a) Primary (1°) Structure</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>primary structure</strong> is the unique, linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, held together by <strong>peptide bonds</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This sequence is determined by the genetic code (DNA). Any change in the primary structure (a mutation) can alter the protein's function (e.g., sickle-cell anemia).</p>

        <h3 id="secondary-structure">b) Secondary (2°) Structure</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>secondary structure</strong> refers to the local, repetitive folding of the polypeptide backbone, stabilized by <strong>hydrogen bonds</strong> between the C=O and N-H groups of the backbone.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The two main types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha-Helix (α-helix):</strong> A right-handed coil. The H-bonds form between the C=O of one amino acid and the N-H of the amino acid four residues ahead. (e.g., in α-keratin).</li>
            <li><strong>Beta-Pleated Sheet (β-sheet):</strong> Formed from two or more polypeptide segments lying side-by-side. The H-bonds form between the backbones of adjacent strands. Strands can be <strong>parallel</strong> or <strong>anti-parallel</strong>. (e.g., in silk fibroin).</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 id="tertiary-structure">c) Tertiary (3°) Structure</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>tertiary structure</strong> is the overall three-dimensional folding of a <em>single</em> polypeptide chain, stabilized by interactions between the <strong>R-groups (side chains)</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This structure defines the protein's specific biological function (e.g., the active site of an enzyme). Myoglobin is a classic example.</p>

        <h3 id="quaternary-structure">d) Quaternary (4°) Structure</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>quaternary structure</strong> is the assembly of two or more separate polypeptide chains (subunits) into a single, functional protein complex. These subunits are held together by the same forces as tertiary structure.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Example: <strong>Hemoglobin</strong>, which consists of four subunits (two α-globin and two β-globin chains).</p>
        <h2 id="stabilizing-forces">4. Forces Stabilizing Protein Structure and Shape</h2>
        <p>These forces are primarily responsible for the 3° and 4° structures.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Covalent Bonds:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peptide Bonds:</strong> Stabilize primary structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disulfide Bonds (—S—S—):</strong> A strong covalent bond formed between the sulfhydryl (—SH) groups of two <strong>cysteine</strong> residues. Crucial for stabilizing proteins like insulin and antibodies.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-Covalent Interactions (weaker, but collectively strong):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hydrogen Bonds:</strong> Form between a hydrogen donor (like N-H or O-H) and a hydrogen acceptor (like C=O). Critical for α-helices, β-sheets, and tertiary folding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydrophobic Interactions:</strong> <span id="spap_3">This is the <strong>primary driving force</strong> for protein folding.</span> Nonpolar (hydrophobic) R-groups cluster together in the protein's core, away from the surrounding water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrostatic Interactions (Salt Bridges):</strong> Attractions between oppositely charged R-groups (e.g., between acidic Asp⁻ and basic Lys⁺).</li>
                    <li><strong>Van der Waals Forces:</strong> Weak, short-range attractions between all atoms.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="protein-purification">6. Protein Purification Techniques</h2>
        <p>To study a protein, it must be isolated from a complex mixture of cells. This involves two main stages: extraction and fractionation.</p>

        <h3>a) Protein Extraction</h3>
        <p>The first step is to get the proteins out of the cell. This is done by <strong>cell lysis</strong> (breaking open the cells) using methods like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mechanical:</strong> Grinding, sonication (ultrasonic vibrations).</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical:</strong> Detergents or enzymes (like lysozyme).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After lysis, cell debris is removed by <strong>centrifugation</strong>, leaving a crude extract containing the protein of interest.</p>

        <h3>b) Fractionation Techniques</h3>
        <p>These techniques separate proteins based on their unique physical properties (size, charge, binding affinity).</p>
        
        <h4>i. Salting Out</h4>
        <p>This technique separates proteins based on <strong>solubility</strong>. By adding a high concentration of a salt (like <strong>Ammonium Sulfate</strong>), the water molecules become solvated by the salt ions, reducing the water available to interact with the protein. The protein precipitates out. Different proteins precipitate at different salt concentrations.</p>

        <h4>ii. Chromatography</h4>
        <p>This is the most powerful set of purification techniques. A "mobile phase" (containing the protein mixture) is passed over a "stationary phase" (a column packed with a resin).</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gel-Filtration Chromatography (Size-Exclusion):</strong>

                    <li><strong>Stationary Phase:</strong> Porous beads.</li>

                    <li><strong>Stationary Phase:</strong> Beads with a specific molecule (a <strong>ligand</strong>) covalently attached.</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation Principle:</strong> Specific binding affinity. The protein of interest binds to the ligand. Other proteins wash through. The bound protein is then eluted by adding a solution that disrupts the binding. This is a very high-specificity technique.</li>

            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> For protein purification questions, be able to explain the *principle* of separation for each technique. For example: Gel-filtration separates by <strong>size</strong>, Ion-exchange by <strong>charge</strong>, and Affinity by <strong>specific binding</strong>.
