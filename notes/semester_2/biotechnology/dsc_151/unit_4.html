        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Enzymes</strong> are biological catalysts. They are (mostly) globular proteins that increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. They are highly specific and highly efficient.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="nomenclature">1. Nomenclature and Classification of Enzymes</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Nomenclature</h3>
        <p>Enzymes are typically named by adding the suffix <strong>"-ase"</strong> to the name of their substrate or the reaction they catalyze.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> Urease (hydrolyzes Urea), Lactase (hydrolyzes Lactose).</li>
            <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> DNA Polymerase (polymerizes DNA), Dehydrogenase (removes hydrogen).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b) Classification (IUBMB)</h3>
        <p>The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) classifies all enzymes into <strong>six major classes</strong>, each with a unique <strong>EC number</strong> (Enzyme Commission number).</p>
        
        <p class="exam-tip"><strong>Mnemonic for the 6 classes:</strong> "<strong>O</strong>ver <strong>T</strong>he <strong>H</strong>ill <strong>L</strong>ies <strong>I</strong>nvisible <strong>L</strong>ight"</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong><span id="spap_9">(EC 1) Oxidoreductases:</span></strong> Catalyze oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions (e.g., Dehydrogenase, Oxidase).</li>
            <li><strong><span id="spap_10">(EC 2) Transferases:</span></strong> Catalyze the transfer of a functional group (e.g., methyl, phosphate) from one molecule to another (e.g., Kinase, Transaminase).</li>
            <li><strong><span id="spap_11">(EC 3) Hydrolases:</span></strong> Catalyze hydrolysis reactions (breaking a bond using water) (e.g., Protease, Lipase, Amylase).</li>
            <li><strong><span id="spap_12">(EC 4) Lyases:</span></strong> Catalyze the cleavage of C-C, C-O, C-N bonds by means *other* than hydrolysis or oxidation, often forming a double bond (e.g., Decarboxylase, Synthase).</li>
            <li><strong><span id="spap_13">(EC 5) Isomerases:</span></strong> Catalyze the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule (e.g., Mutase, Isomerase).</li>
            <li><strong><span id="spap_14">(EC 6) Ligases:</span></strong> Catalyze the joining of two molecules, coupled with the hydrolysis of ATP (e.g., DNA Ligase, Synthetase).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="specificity">2. Enzyme Specificity</h2>
        <p>This is a hallmark property of enzymes. Specificity refers to the ability of an enzyme to bind and catalyze only one or a small group of substrates.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute Specificity:</strong> Catalyzes only one specific substrate (e.g., Urease only acts on urea).</li>
            <li><strong>Group Specificity:</strong> Acts on a group of substrates with a similar structure (e.g., Hexokinase phosphorylates various hexose sugars like glucose, fructose).</li>
            <li><strong>Stereospecificity:</strong> Acts on only one stereoisomer (L- or D-) of a substrate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="models">3. Models of Enzyme Action (Lock-and-Key and Induced-Fit)</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Active Site</h3>
        <p>The <strong>active site</strong> is a specific 3D cleft or pocket on the enzyme's surface where the substrate binds and the chemical reaction occurs.</p>

        <h3>b) Lock-and-Key Model (Emil Fischer, 1894)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept:</strong> The active site has a rigid, pre-formed shape that is perfectly complementary to the substrate, like a lock and its key.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> This model is too rigid and does not explain how the enzyme stabilizes the transition state.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>c) Induced-Fit Model (Daniel Koshland, 1958)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept:</strong> The active site is flexible, not rigid. The binding of the substrate <em>induces</em> a conformational change in the enzyme, causing the active site to "wrap around" the substrate.</li>
            <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This is the more accepted model. This "hugging" (induced fit) strains the substrate's bonds and orients the catalytic groups, which helps stabilize the <strong>transition state</strong> and lower the activation energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="activation-energy">4. Activation Energy (E<sub>A</sub>)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Activation Energy (E<sub>A</sub>)</strong> is the minimum amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction, or the energy needed to reach the high-energy <strong>transition state</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Enzymes do not change the overall free energy (ΔG) of a reaction.</strong> Instead, they speed up the reaction rate by <strong>lowering the activation energy (E<sub>A</sub>)</strong>. They do this by providing an alternative reaction pathway and stabilizing the transition state.</p>

        <h2 id="factors">5. Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Effect of Temperature</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As temperature increases, the reaction rate increases (more kinetic energy).</li>
            <li>However, above an <strong>optimal temperature</strong>, the enzyme begins to <strong>denature</strong> (lose its 3D structure), and the rate drops rapidly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>b) Effect of pH</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each enzyme has an <strong>optimal pH</strong> at which its activity is maximal (e.g., Pepsin ≈ pH 2; Trypsin ≈ pH 8).</li>
            <li>Extreme pH (too acidic or basic) alters the ionization state of the amino acid R-groups in the active site and can lead to denaturation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>c) Effect of Substrate Concentration [S]</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At a fixed enzyme concentration, as [S] increases, the reaction rate (velocity, V) increases...</li>
            <li>...until the enzyme becomes <strong>saturated</strong>. At this point, all active sites are occupied, and the reaction reaches its <strong>maximum velocity (V<sub>max</sub>)</strong>.</li>
            <li>This relationship is described by the <strong>Michaelis-Menten equation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="inhibition">6. Enzyme Inhibition (Reversible and Irreversible)</h2>
        <p>Inhibitors are molecules that reduce or stop enzyme activity. This is a key mechanism for regulating metabolic pathways and is the basis for many drugs.</p>
        
        <h3>a) Reversible Inhibition</h3>
        <p>The inhibitor binds non-covalently and can be removed, restoring enzyme activity.</p>
        
        <table>

            <tbody>
                <tr>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Non-competitive</strong></td>
                    <td>Inhibitor binds to an <strong>allosteric site</strong> (not the active site), changing the enzyme's shape.</td>
                    <td><strong>No change</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Decreases</strong> (cannot be overcome by [S])</td>

                <tr>

                    <td>Inhibitor binds <em>only</em> to the <strong>enzyme-substrate (ES) complex</strong>.</td>
                    <td><strong>Decreases</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Decreases</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Understand the competitive vs. non-competitive inhibition table. This is a classic topic. Remember: Competitive inhibitors "compete" for the active site.
        </div>

        <h3>b) Irreversible Inhibition</h3>
        <p>The inhibitor binds <em>covalently</em> to the enzyme, permanently disabling it. Examples include heavy metals (mercury, lead) and some nerve gases.</p>

        <h2 id="cofactors">7. Cofactors and Prosthetic Groups</h2>
        <p>Many enzymes require a non-protein chemical component to be active.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Apoenzyme</strong> (inactive protein part) + <strong>Cofactor</strong> (non-protein part) = <strong>Holoenzyme</strong> (active enzyme)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Cofactors can be:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inorganic Ions:</strong> Metal ions like Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, Fe²⁺. They often help in binding the substrate or stabilizing the enzyme structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Coenzymes:</strong> Organic (carbon-based) molecules.
                <ul>
                    <li>They are often derived from <strong>vitamins</strong> (e.g., NAD⁺ from Niacin/B3; FAD from Riboflavin/B2).</li>
                    <li>They act as transient carriers of specific functional groups.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Prosthetic Groups</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A <strong>prosthetic group</strong> is a coenzyme (or metal ion) that is <strong>tightly and covalently</strong> (or very strongly) bound to the apoenzyme, forming a permanent part of the active enzyme.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The <strong>heme group</strong> in enzymes like catalase and cytochrome oxidase is a prosthetic group.</p>
