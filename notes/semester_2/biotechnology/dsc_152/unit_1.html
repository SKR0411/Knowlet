            <strong>Practical Exam Instruction:</strong> Two Experiments are to be performed, one from each part (Part A and Part B).
        </div>

        <h2>Part A: Cell Biology and Biochemistry</h2>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment A.1: Preparation of solutions and buffers</h3>
            <p><strong>(a) Preparation of Molar Solutions (e.g., 1M NaCl)</strong></p>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To prepare a solution of a specific molarity.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>A <strong>Molar (M)</strong> solution contains one mole of a solute dissolved in a final volume of one liter (1L) of solvent. Molarity is a unit of concentration (mol/L).
            <br><strong>Formula:</strong> Molarity (M) = (Weight of Solute in g) / (Molecular Weight of Solute × Volume of Solution in L)
            <br>To find the weight needed: <strong>Weight (g) = Molarity × Molecular Weight × Volume (L)</strong></p>
            <h4>Procedure (Example: 100mL of 1M NaCl)</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">
                <li><strong>Calculate:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Molecular Weight (MW) of NaCl = 23 (Na) + 35.5 (Cl) = 58.5 g/mol</li>
                        <li>Weight needed = 1 mol/L × 58.5 g/mol × 0.1 L = 5.85 g</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Weigh:</strong> Accurately weigh 5.85 g of dry NaCl using a weighing balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Dissolve:</strong> Add the NaCl to a 100mL beaker with ~70-80mL of deionized water. Stir until fully dissolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Make up Volume:</strong> Transfer the solution to a 100mL volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker with a small amount of water and add the rinsing to the flask. Carefully add water to the flask until the bottom of the meniscus touches the 100mL calibration mark.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix:</strong> Cap the flask and invert it 10-15 times to ensure a homogenous solution.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>(b) Preparation of Buffers (e.g., Phosphate Buffer)</strong></p>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To prepare a buffer solution that resists changes in pH.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>A <strong>buffer</strong> is a solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid). It resists pH changes upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base. The <strong>Henderson-Hasselbalch equation</strong> is used to calculate the ratio of acid to base needed for a specific pH:
            <br><strong>pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )</strong></p>
            <h4>Procedure (Example: 0.1M Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.2)</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">
                <li><strong>Choose components:</strong> Use a weak acid/conjugate base pair with a pKa close to 7.2. For phosphate, the relevant pair is H₂PO₄⁻ (acid, pKa = 7.21) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). We use their salts, e.g., Monosodium Phosphate (NaH₂PO₄) and Disodium Phosphate (Na₂HPO₄).</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate Ratio:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>7.20 = 7.21 + log ( [Na₂HPO₄] / [NaH₂PO₄] )</li>
                        <li>-0.01 = log ( [Base] / [Acid] )</li>
                        <li>[Base] / [Acid] = 10<sup>-0.01</sup> = 0.977</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Stock Solutions:</strong> Prepare 100mL each of 0.1M NaH₂PO₄ (Stock A) and 0.1M Na₂HPO₄ (Stock B).</li>
                <li><strong>Mix:</strong> Mix the two stock solutions in the calculated ratio (e.g., ~49.4 mL of Stock B and ~50.6 mL of Stock A).</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust pH:</strong> Place a pH meter electrode in the solution. Slowly add drops of Stock B (to raise pH) or Stock A (to lower pH) until the meter reads exactly 7.20.</li>
                <li><strong>Make up Volume:</strong> If necessary, add water to reach the final desired volume (e.g., 100mL).</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment A.2: Handling and working principle of simple and compound microscope</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To understand the parts and working principle of a compound light microscope.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>A <strong>compound microscope</strong> uses two sets of lenses to produce a magnified, two-dimensional image.
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Objective Lens</strong> (near the specimen) produces an inverted, real, and magnified primary image.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Eyepiece Lens (Ocular)</strong> (what you look through) magnifies this primary image further to produce a final, virtual, and highly magnified image.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Total Magnification = Magnification of Objective × Magnification of Ocular</strong>
            (e.g., 40x Objective × 10x Ocular = 400x Total Magnification)</p>

            <h4>Procedure (Handling and Use)</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">
                <li><strong>Handling:</strong> Always carry the microscope with two hands: one on the <strong>arm</strong> and one supporting the <strong>base</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Place a prepared slide on the <strong>stage</strong> and secure it with the <strong>stage clips</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Focusing (Low Power):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with the lowest power objective (e.g., 4x or 10x).</li>
                        <li>Look from the side and use the <strong>coarse adjustment knob</strong> to bring the stage as close to the objective as possible without touching.</li>
                        <li>Look through the eyepiece and turn the coarse adjustment knob <em>slowly</em> to move the stage *away* from the lens until the image comes into view.</li>
                        <li>Use the <strong>fine adjustment knob</strong> to get a sharp, clear image.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Focusing (High Power):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once focused on low power, rotate the <strong>revolving nosepiece</strong> to the high power objective (e.g., 40x).</li>
                        <li>The microscope should be <strong>parfocal</strong> (remain mostly in focus). <strong>Only use the fine adjustment knob</strong> to sharpen the image. <strong>Never use the coarse knob with high power.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Oil Immersion (100x):</strong> Place a drop of immersion oil on the coverslip before rotating the 100x objective into place. This lens must make contact with the oil.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="precaution">
                <strong>Precautions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always start and finish with the lowest power objective.</li>
                    <li>Clean lenses *only* with specified lens paper and cleaning solution.</li>
                    <li>Never touch the lenses with your fingers.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="experiment">
            <h3>Experiment A.3: Study of mitosis in onion root tips</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To prepare a slide of an onion root tip and identify the different stages of mitosis.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>The <strong>meristematic tissue</strong> at the very tip of an onion root is a region of rapid cell division (mitosis). Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells. It is divided into four main stages: <strong>Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase</strong>. (Interphase is the non-dividing stage).</p>
            <h4>Materials</h4>
            <p>Onion root tips (pre-fixed in Carnoy's fluid), 1N HCl, Acetocarmine or Feulgen stain, glass slides, coverslips, spirit lamp, microscope.</p>
            <h4>Procedure</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">
                <li><strong>Hydrolysis:</strong> Place one root tip in a drop of 1N HCl on a slide. Gently warm the slide over a spirit lamp (do not boil) for 30-60 seconds. This breaks down the middle lamella, softening the tissue.</li>
                <li><strong>Staining:</strong> Blot the excess HCl and add 1-2 drops of acetocarmine stain. Leave for 2-5 minutes. The stain binds to the chromatin (chromosomes).</li>
                <li><strong>Mounting:</strong> Place a coverslip over the tip.</li>
                <li><strong>Squashing:</strong> Place a piece of filter paper over the coverslip and firmly press down with your thumb. This squashes the tissue into a single cell layer. Avoid any lateral movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Observe the slide under low power (10x) to find a good region, then switch to high power (40x or 45x) to identify the stages.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Observations</h4>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interphase:</strong> Nucleus is intact, chromatin is not condensed (looks grainy).</li>
                <li><strong>Prophase:</strong> Chromatin condenses into visible, thread-like chromosomes. Nuclear envelope begins to break down.</li>
                <li><strong>Metaphase:</strong> Chromosomes (each with two sister chromatids) align at the center of the cell, forming the <strong>metaphase plate</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Anaphase:</strong> Sister chromatids separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. They are now individual chromosomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Telophase:</strong> Chromosomes arrive at the poles, decondense, and nuclear envelopes re-form around the two new sets. A <strong>cell plate</strong> begins to form in the middle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiment A.4: Study of structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To observe prepared slides of prokaryotic (bacteria) and eukaryotic (plant/animal) cells and identify their key structural differences.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>Cells are the fundamental units of life. They are broadly classified as prokaryotic (lacking a true nucleus) or eukaryotic (possessing a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles).</p>
            
            <h4>Procedure</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">
                <li><strong>Prokaryotic Cell (e.g., Bacteria):</strong>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Identify the cell shape (coccus, bacillus, spirillum).</li>
                        <li>Note the absence of a visible nucleus and organelles. Only the cell wall, cell membrane, and cytoplasm are discernible.</li>

                        <li>Smear the cells in a drop of saline on a slide, add a drop of methylene blue stain, and cover with a coverslip.</li>
                        <li>Observe under 40x. Identify the prominent, dark-stained <strong>nucleus</strong>, the <strong>cytoplasm</strong>, and the <strong>cell membrane</strong>. Note the irregular shape.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To determine the optimal pH and optimal temperature for the enzymatic activity of salivary amylase.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p><strong>Salivary amylase</strong> (Ptyalin) is an enzyme that breaks down starch (a polysaccharide) into smaller sugars (maltose). Enzyme activity is highly sensitive to pH and temperature. At <strong>optimal pH/temperature</strong>, the enzyme has the correct 3D shape (conformation) and maximum activity. Extreme pH or high temperatures cause the enzyme to <strong>denature</strong> (lose its shape) and its activity.
            <br><strong>Assay:</strong> We measure activity by observing the disappearance of starch. Starch gives a <strong>blue-black</strong> color with iodine. As amylase breaks it down, the color fades, eventually reaching an <strong>achromic point</strong> (no color). Shorter time to reach this point = higher enzyme activity.</p>
            <h4>Procedure (Effect of pH)</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">
                <li><strong>Prepare Saliva Solution:</strong> Collect saliva and dilute it 10-fold with saline. This is the enzyme source.</li>
                <li><strong>Setup Test Tubes:</strong> Label 5 test tubes. In each, add:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tube 1: 1mL pH 5.0 buffer</li>
                        <li>Tube 2: 1mL pH 6.0 buffer</li>
                        <li>Tube 3: 1mL pH 7.0 buffer (e.g., neutral saline)</li>
                        <li>Tube 4: 1mL pH 8.0 buffer</li>
                        <li>Tube 5: 1mL pH 9.0 buffer</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> Add 1mL of 1% starch solution to each tube.</li>
                <li><strong>Incubate:</strong> Place all tubes in a 37°C water bath (optimal temp) for 5 minutes to equilibrate.</li>
                <li><strong>Start Reaction:</strong> Add 0.5mL of the saliva solution to *each* tube. Start a stopwatch.</li>
                <li><strong>Test for Activity:</strong> At 1-minute intervals, take a drop from each tube and add it to a drop of iodine solution on a spotting tile.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Blue-black color:</strong> Starch is still present.</li>
                        <li><strong>No color (yellow-brown of iodine):</strong> Starch is fully digested (achromic point).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Record:</strong> Note the time taken for each pH tube to reach the achromic point.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Procedure (Effect of Temperature)</h4>
            <p>Repeat the same process, but use only the optimal pH buffer (e.g., pH 7.0) in all tubes. Place each tube in a different water bath (e.g., 0°C, 25°C, 37°C, 60°C, 90°C).</p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Effect of pH:</strong> The tube closest to pH 6.8-7.0 will show the fastest activity (shortest time). Activity will be very low at pH 5 and 9.</li>
                <li><strong>Effect of Temperature:</strong> The tube at 37°C will be fastest. The 0°C tube will be very slow (enzyme inactive). The 90°C tube will show no activity (enzyme denatured).</li>

            <h3>Experiment A.6: Estimation of blood glucose by glucose oxidase method</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To estimate the concentration of glucose in a given blood serum sample using the GOD-POD (Glucose Oxidase-Peroxidase) method.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>This is a colorimetric estimation. The reaction occurs in two steps:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Glucose Oxidase (GOD):</strong>
                    <br>Glucose + O₂ + H₂O → Gluconic Acid + H₂O₂ (Hydrogen Peroxide)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Peroxidase (POD):</strong>
                    <br>H₂O₂ + 4-Aminoantipyrine + Phenol (colorless) → Quinoneimine (<strong>pink-colored dye</strong>) + H₂O
                </li>
            </ol>
            The intensity of the pink color is directly proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. We measure this intensity using a <strong>colorimeter</strong> at ~530 nm and compare it to a known <strong>standard</strong>.</p>
            <h4>Procedure</h4>
            <ol class="procedure">

                </li>
                <li><strong>Incubate:</strong> Mix all tubes and incubate at 37°C (or room temp) for 10-15 minutes for the color to develop.</li>

                        <li>Use the <strong>Blank (B)</strong> to set the absorbance to zero.</li>
                        <li>Read and record the absorbance (Optical Density, OD) of the <strong>Standard (S)</strong> and the <strong>Test (T)</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Calculations</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>(Absorbance of Test / Absorbance of Standard) × Concentration of Standard = Conc. of Glucose in Sample</strong>

            <br>Glucose Conc. = (0.25 / 0.20) × 100 mg/dL = <strong>125 mg/dL</strong></p>

            </ol>
            The intensity of the blue color is proportional to the protein concentration, measured at 660-750 nm.</p>

            <h3>Experiment A.8: Separation of amino acids by paper chromatography</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To separate a mixture of amino acids using ascending paper chromatography.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p><strong>Chromatography</strong> separates components of a mixture based on their differential distribution between two phases: a <strong>stationary phase</strong> and a <strong>mobile phase</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stationary Phase:</strong> The water molecules bound to the cellulose fibers of the <strong>Whatman No. 1 chromatography paper</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Phase:</strong> A nonpolar organic solvent (e.g., Butanol:Acetic Acid:Water) that moves up the paper by <strong>capillary action</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            Separation occurs based on <strong>partition coefficient</strong> (solubility). Amino acids that are *more soluble* in the mobile phase will travel *faster and further* up the paper. Amino acids that are *less soluble* (more polar, more affinity for the stationary phase) will travel *slower*.</p>
            <h4>Procedure</h4>
            <ol class="procedure"><li><strong>Prepare Paper:</strong> Cut a Whatman No. 1 paper strip. Draw a pencil line (origin) 2 cm from the bottom.</li>
                <li><strong>Spot:</strong> Using a capillary tube, apply a small, concentrated spot of the amino acid mixture on the origin. Let it dry. Repeat 2-3 times.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Chamber:</strong> Pour the mobile phase into a chromatography chamber/jar to a depth of 1 cm. Cover and let it saturate with solvent vapor.</li>
                <li><strong>Run:</strong> Hang or stand the paper in the chamber so the bottom edge (but not the spot) is submerged in the solvent. Cover the chamber.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop:</strong> Allow the solvent to run up the paper (ascending) for 1-2 hours or until the <strong>solvent front</strong> is ~2 cm from the top.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry:</strong> Remove the paper, mark the solvent front with a pencil, and let it dry completely (preferably in a fume hood).</li>
                <li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Spray the paper with <strong>Ninhydrin solution</strong> and heat it in a hot air oven (80-100°C) for 2-5 minutes. Amino acids will appear as <strong>purple spots</strong> (Proline gives a yellow spot).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Calculations (R<sub>f</sub> Value)</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Retention Factor (R<sub>f</sub>)</strong> is a ratio that helps identify the components. It is constant for a given amino acid under specific conditions.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>R<sub>f</sub> = (Distance traveled by the amino acid spot) / (Distance traveled by the solvent front)</strong>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Measure from the origin line. The R<sub>f</sub> value is always less than 1. Compare the R<sub>f</sub> values of the unknown spots to known standards to identify them.</p>

                <strong>Precaution:</strong> All procedures must be done under <strong>aseptic conditions</strong> (near a flame or in a laminar flow hood) to prevent contamination. All media and glassware must be sterilized (autoclaved).

            <h3>Experiment B.6: Determination of total coliform bacteria in water sample</h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>To test a water sample for the presence and quantity of coliform bacteria, which are indicators of fecal contamination.</p>
            <h4>Principle</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Most Probable Number (MPN)</strong> method is used. Coliforms are bacteria (like <em>E. coli</em>) that ferment lactose, producing <strong>acid and gas</strong>.
            <br>We inoculate the water sample into <strong>MacConkey Broth</strong>, which contains lactose and a pH indicator.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive Result:</strong> Broth turns <strong>yellow</strong> (acid production) AND gas is trapped in the small, inverted <strong>Durham tube</strong> inside.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Result:</strong> Broth remains red/purple, and no gas is produced.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Procedure (Presumptive Test)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set up tubes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 tubes of <strong>double-strength</strong> MacConkey Broth (DSMB).</li>
                        <li>6 tubes of <strong>single-strength</strong> MacConkey Broth (SSMB).</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><strong>Inoculate:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add <strong>10 mL</strong> of the water sample to each of the 3 DSMB tubes.</li>
                        <li>Add <strong>1.0 mL</strong> of the water sample to 3 of the SSMB tubes.</li>
                        <li>Add <strong>0.1 mL</strong> of the water sample to the remaining 3 SSMB tubes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incubate:</strong> Incubate all 9 tubes at 37°C for 48 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Record Results:</strong> After 48 hours, count the number of positive tubes (yellow color + gas) in each set.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Calculations</h4>
            <p>Record the result as a 3-digit combination (e.g., "3-2-1" means 3 positive in the 10mL set, 2 positive in the 1mL set, and 1 positive in the 0.1mL set).
            <br>Compare this combination to a standard <strong>MPN Statistical Table</strong> to find the "Most Probable Number" of coliforms per 100 mL of the original water sample.</p>
            
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Drinking water should have an MPN of 0 coliforms / 100 mL.</strong>
