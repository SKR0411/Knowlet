            <h2>Case Study 1: Water Sample Analysis</h2>
            <p>This involves collecting a water sample (e.g., from a river, lake, or tap) and determining its key quality parameters. This is crucial for checking its potability (safety for drinking) or its level of pollution.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Determination of pH</h3>
            <p><strong>Method:</strong> Measured using a calibrated pH meter.
            <br><strong>Importance:</strong> Most aquatic life thrives in a neutral range (6.5-8.5). Highly acidic or basic water is indicative of industrial pollution.</p>

            <h3>2. Determination of Acidity</h3>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Measures the water's capacity to neutralize a strong base. It's often due to dissolved CO₂ (carbonic acid).
            <br><strong>Method:</strong> A simple acid-base titration. The water sample is titrated with a standard <strong>NaOH</strong> solution using <strong>phenolphthalein</strong> indicator.
            <br><strong>Endpoint:</strong> Colorless to faint pink.</p>

            <h3>3. Determination of Alkalinity</h3>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Measures the water's capacity to neutralize a strong acid (its "buffering capacity"). It is mainly due to bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) and carbonate (CO₃²⁻) ions.
            <br><strong>Method:</strong> An acid-base titration. The water sample is titrated with a standard <strong>H₂SO₄</strong> or <strong>HCl</strong> solution.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phenolphthalein Alkalinity (P-Alkalinity):</strong> Titrated to the phenolphthalein endpoint (pH 8.3). Measures all carbonate and hydroxide.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Alkalinity (M-Alkalinity):</strong> Titration is continued (or started) to the <strong>Methyl Orange</strong> endpoint (pH ~4.5). Measures all carbonate, bicarbonate, and hydroxide.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h3>4. Determination of Dissolved Oxygen (DO)</h3>
            <p><strong>Principle (Winkler's Titration):</strong> DO is the amount of O₂ dissolved in water, which is essential for aquatic life. Low DO indicates pollution. This is a complex redox titration.
            <ol>
                <li>The O₂ in the water is "fixed" by adding MnSO₄ and an alkali-iodide solution. This forms a precipitate of Mn(OH)₂.</li>
                <li>The dissolved O₂ oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(III) or Mn(IV).</li>
                <li>When acid is added, the manganese oxidizes the iodide (I⁻) from the reagent to form free <strong>Iodine (I₂)</strong>.</li>
                <li>The amount of I₂ formed is *equivalent* to the amount of O₂ originally in the water.</li>
                <li>This I₂ is then titrated with a standard <strong>sodium thiosulphate (Na₂S₂O₃)</strong> solution using <strong>starch</strong> indicator.</li>
                <li><strong>Endpoint:</strong> Blue to colorless.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>5. Determination of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</h3>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> BOD measures the amount of dissolved oxygen <strong>consumed by microorganisms</strong> (bacteria) while they decompose organic waste in the water.
            <br>It is the <strong>most important indicator of organic pollution</strong> (e.g., sewage).</p>
            <p><strong>Method:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Take two bottles of the water sample.</li>
                <li>Measure the Dissolved Oxygen in the first bottle immediately (this is <strong>DO_initial</strong>).</li>
                <li>Incubate the second bottle in complete darkness at 20°C for <strong>5 days</strong>.</li>
                <li>After 5 days, measure the Dissolved Oxygen in the second bottle (this is <strong>DO_final</strong>).</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Calculation:</strong>
                <br>
                BOD (in mg/L) = DO_initial - DO_final
            </blockquote>
            <p>A high BOD (e.g., > 5 mg/L) means the water is heavily polluted with organic waste.</p>

            <h3>6. Determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)</h3>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> COD measures *all* chemically oxidizable substances in water (both biodegradable and non-biodegradable). It is always higher than BOD.
            <br>
            <strong>Method:</strong> A powerful chemical oxidizing agent, <strong>potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇)</strong>, is used to chemically "digest" (oxidize) the organic matter in the sample.
            <br>
            The amount of dichromate *consumed* is measured by titration, which is proportional to the amount of organic matter.</p>

            <h2>Case Study 2: Soil Sample Analysis</h2>
            <p>This involves collecting a soil sample and analyzing it for key macro-nutrients to assess its fertility, building on the techniques from Unit 2.</p>

            <h3>1. Determination of pH</h3>
            <p><strong>Method:</strong> A soil-water suspension (e.g., 1:2 ratio) is prepared, and the pH is measured with a pH meter.
            <br><strong>Importance:</strong> Most plants prefer a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. pH affects nutrient availability; for example, in highly acidic soil, aluminum can become toxic, and nutrients like phosphorus become unavailable.</p>

            <h3>2. Determination of Macro Nutrients (K, Ca, Mg)</h3>
            <p>These are "secondary" macro-nutrients, essential for plant growth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Potassium (K):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Role:</strong> Essential for enzyme activation, water regulation (stomata opening/closing), and general plant vigor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Method:</strong> After extracting the nutrients from the soil (e.g., with an ammonium acetate solution), the concentration of K is determined quickly and accurately using <strong>Flame Photometry</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Role:</strong> Calcium is vital for cell wall structure. Magnesium is the central atom in the <strong>chlorophyll</strong> molecule (essential for photosynthesis).</li>
                        <li><strong>Method:</strong> The extracted solution is analyzed by <strong>Complexometric (EDTA) Titration</strong>. As seen in Unit 2, titrating at pH 10 gives total Ca+Mg, while titrating at pH 12-13 gives Ca only.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
