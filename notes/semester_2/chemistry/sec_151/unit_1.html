            <h2>Importance of Analytical Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Analytical Chemistry</strong> is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. It answers the question, "What is it, and how much of it is there?"</p>
            <h3>Interdisciplinary Nature:</h3>
            <p>Analytical chemistry is a service science; it's essential to nearly all other scientific fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Blood tests (e.g., glucose, cholesterol levels), drug analysis, and disease diagnosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Monitoring water and air pollution (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals).</li>
                <li><strong>Food Science:</strong> Checking for nutritional value, detecting adulterants, and ensuring safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Forensics:</strong> Analyzing DNA, fibers, and unknown substances at a crime scene.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Quality control to ensure a product (like plastic, metal, or pharmaceuticals) meets specifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Concept of Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Sampling</strong> is the process of selecting a small, representative portion of a large bulk material for analysis. It is often the most critical step, as the analysis result is useless if the sample is not representative of the whole.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Example:</strong> To analyze a 10-ton shipment of grain for protein, you can't test the whole shipment. You must take small amounts from multiple bags/locations and combine them (a "composite sample") to accurately represent the average protein content.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Homogeneous Sample:</strong> A sample that is uniform throughout (e.g., a clear salt solution). Sampling is easy.</li>
                <li><strong>Heterogeneous Sample:</strong> A sample with non-uniform composition (e.g., a soil sample, a chocolate chip cookie). Sampling is difficult and requires careful procedures (like grinding, mixing, and quartering) to get a representative portion.</li>

            <h3>Sources of Error in Analysis</h3>
            <p>An error is the difference between the measured value and the true value.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Systematic (or Determinate) Errors:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What:</strong> A reproducible error that is always in one direction (e.g., always too high or always too low). It affects <strong>accuracy</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Faulty equipment (e.g., uncalibrated balance), incorrect method, or personal bias (e.g., consistently misreading a burette).</li>
                        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Can be identified and corrected (e.g., by calibrating equipment).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Random (or Indeterminate) Errors:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What:</strong> Unpredictable, small errors that can be positive or negative. They affect <strong>precision</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Natural limitations of measurement (e.g., fluctuation in temperature, electronic noise in an instrument).</li>
                        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Cannot be eliminated, but can be minimized by taking multiple measurements and calculating an average.</li>

            <h2>Significant Figures</h2>
            <p>Significant figures are all the certain digits in a measurement plus one uncertain (estimated) digit. They indicate the precision of a measurement.</p>
            <h3>Rules for Counting:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Non-zero digits</strong> are always significant (e.g., 22.5 has 3).</li>
                <li><strong>Captive zeros</strong> (between non-zero digits) are significant (e.g., 2.05 has 3).</li>
                <li><strong>Leading zeros</strong> (before non-zero digits) are NOT significant (e.g., 0.0025 has 2).</li>
                <li><strong>Trailing zeros</strong> are significant ONLY if there is a decimal point (e.g., 25.0 has 3; 2500 has 2, but 2500. has 4).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Rules for Calculations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> The answer is limited by the number with the *fewest decimal places*.
                <br>(e.g., 12.52 + 5.1 = 17.62 → rounds to <strong>17.6</strong>)</li>
                <li><strong>Multiplication/Division:</strong> The answer is limited by the number with the *fewest significant figures*.
                <br>(e.g., 12.52 (4 sig figs) × 5.1 (2 sig figs) = 63.852 → rounds to <strong>64</strong>)</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Molarity (M):</strong> Moles of solute per liter of solution (mol/L). Used in titrations.</li>

                <li><strong>Normality (N):</strong> Gram equivalent weight of solute per liter of solution. (Often Molarity × n-factor).</li>
                <li><strong>Parts Per Million (ppm):</strong> Milligrams of solute per liter of solution (mg/L). Used for very dilute solutions, like pollutants in water. (1 ppm = 1 mg/kg)</li>
                <li><strong>Parts Per Billion (ppb):</strong> Micrograms of solute per liter of solution (µg/L). Used for trace-level analysis.</li>

            <h2>Introduction to Chromatography</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> Chromatography is a powerful laboratory technique used to <strong>separate the components of a mixture</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Principle:</h3>
            <p>All chromatographic separations work based on differential partitioning. The mixture is dissolved in a <strong>mobile phase</strong> (a liquid or gas), which is then passed over a <strong>stationary phase</strong> (a solid or a liquid coated on a solid).</p>
            <p>The components of the mixture separate because they have different affinities (attractions) for the two phases.
            <ul>
                <li>A component that is <strong>strongly attracted to the stationary phase</strong> will move <strong>slowly</strong>.</li>
                <li>A component that is <strong>more soluble in the mobile phase</strong> will move <strong>quickly</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            This difference in speed causes the components to separate into distinct bands.

            <h2>Paper Chromatography</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stationary Phase:</strong> A high-quality filter paper (cellulose). The <strong>water</strong> trapped in the pores of the paper is the true stationary phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Phase:</strong> A developing solvent (e.g., a mixture of alcohol and water).</li>
                <li><strong>Technique:</strong>
                    1. A spot of the mixture (e.g., ink) is applied near the bottom of the paper.
                    2. The paper is suspended in a sealed jar with the bottom edge (below the spot) dipped into the mobile phase.
                    3. The solvent moves up the paper by <strong>capillary action</strong>, carrying the components of the mixture with it.
                    4. The components separate into different colored spots.

            <h2>Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)</h2>
            <p>A faster and more efficient version of paper chromatography.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stationary Phase:</strong> A thin layer (e.g., 0.25 mm) of an adsorbent material (like <strong>silica gel</strong> or <strong>alumina</strong>) coated onto a glass plate or plastic sheet.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Phase:</strong> A solvent or solvent mixture in a developing tank.</li>
                <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Similar to paper chromatography. A small spot of the sample is applied, and the plate is placed in a sealed tank with the solvent. The solvent moves up by capillary action, separating the components.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> If the spots are colorless, they can be visualized by spraying with a reagent (e.g., ninhydrin for amino acids) or by viewing under UV light.</li>
            </ul>
            [Image of a TLC plate showing separated spots]
            
            <h3>R_f Value (Retardation Factor)</h3>
            <p>Used in both TLC and paper chromatography to identify components.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>R_f = (Distance traveled by the spot) / (Distance traveled by the solvent front)</strong>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>The R_f value is always between 0 and 1.</li>
                <li>It is a characteristic constant for a specific compound, in a specific solvent system, on a specific stationary phase.</li>
                <li>By comparing the R_f value of an unknown spot to the R_f value of a known standard, one can identify the unknown.</li>
