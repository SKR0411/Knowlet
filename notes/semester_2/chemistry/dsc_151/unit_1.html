            <h2>Organic Compounds: Classification, Nomenclature, and Hybridization</h2>
            
            <h3>Classification of Organic Compounds</h3>
            <p>Organic compounds are broadly classified based on their carbon skeleton:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acyclic (or Open-chain) compounds:</strong> These compounds have an open-chain structure. They can be straight-chain (e.g., n-butane) or branched (e.g., isobutane).</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclic (or Closed-chain) compounds:</strong> These compounds contain one or more closed rings of atoms.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Alicyclic:</strong> Cyclic compounds that behave like their acyclic counterparts (e.g., cyclohexane).</li>
                        <li><strong>Aromatic:</strong> Cyclic compounds containing a special, stable ring system, most commonly the benzene ring (e.g., benzene, naphthalene).</li>
                        <li><strong>Heterocyclic:</strong> Cyclic compounds where at least one atom in the ring is an element other than carbon (e.g., pyridine, furan).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>They are also classified by <strong>functional groups</strong>, which are specific atoms or groups of atoms that determine the characteristic chemical properties of a molecule (e.g., -OH for alcohols, -COOH for carboxylic acids).</p>

            <h3>Nomenclature (IUPAC)</h3>
            <p>The IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system provides a systematic way to name organic compounds. The name generally consists of three parts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Word Root:</strong> Indicates the number of carbon atoms in the principal chain (e.g., 'Meth-' for 1 C, 'Eth-' for 2 C, 'Prop-' for 3 C).</li>
                <li><strong>Suffix:</strong> Indicates the type of bond (primary suffix) or the principal functional group (secondary suffix).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Primary: '-ane' (C-C), '-ene' (C=C), '-yne' (C≡C).</li>
                        <li>Secondary: '-ol' (alcohol), '-al' (aldehyde), '-one' (ketone).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prefix:</strong> Indicates any substituents (e.g., 'methyl-', 'chloro-') or if the compound is cyclic ('cyclo-').</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> 3-methylbutan-2-ol. 'But-' (4C chain), '-an-' (all C-C single bonds), '-ol' (alcohol group), '2-' (alcohol on C2), '3-methyl' (a methyl group on C3).</p>

            <h3>Hybridization and Shapes of Molecules</h3>
            <p>Hybridization is the concept of mixing atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals, which are better suited for bonding and explaining molecular geometry.</p>

            <h3>Influence of Hybridization on Bond Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bond Length:</strong> As the s-character increases, the hybrid orbitals become shorter and fatter. This leads to greater overlap and a shorter, stronger bond.
                    <br><strong>Trend:</strong> sp³-sp³ (longest) > sp²-sp² > sp-sp (shortest).
                    <br>(e.g., C-C in ethane > C=C in ethene > C≡C in ethyne).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bond Strength:</strong> Shorter bonds are stronger.
                    <br><strong>Trend:</strong> sp-sp (strongest) > sp²-sp² > sp³-sp³ (weakest).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Electronegativity:</strong> The s-orbital is closer to the nucleus than the p-orbital. Therefore, an atom's electronegativity increases with increasing s-character.
                    <br><strong>Trend:</strong> sp (most electronegative) > sp² > sp³ (least electronegative). This explains why the hydrogen in ethyne is acidic.

            <h2>Electronic Displacements in Covalent Bonds</h2>
            <p>These are effects that describe how electrons are distributed in a molecule, which in turn explains its reactivity. They can be permanent or temporary.</p>
            
            <h3>Inductive Effect (I Effect)</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The permanent partial displacement of shared (sigma, σ) electrons along a carbon chain towards a more electronegative atom or group.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>It's a <strong>permanent effect</strong> and weakens rapidly with distance (negligible after 3 bonds).</li>
                <li><strong>-I Effect (Electron-withdrawing):</strong> Shown by groups more electronegative than carbon.
                    <br><strong>Example Groups:</strong> -NO₂, -CN, -COOH, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -OH.
                    <br><strong>Application:</strong> Chloroacetic acid (Cl-CH₂-COOH) is a stronger acid than acetic acid (CH₃-COOH) because the -Cl group pulls electron density, stabilizing the resulting carboxylate anion.
                </li>
                <li><strong>+I Effect (Electron-donating):</strong> Shown by groups less electronegative than carbon.
                    <br><strong>Example Groups:</strong> Alkyl groups (e.g., -CH₃, -C₂H₅).
                    <br><strong>Application:</strong> The +I effect of alkyl groups stabilizes carbocations.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Electromeric Effect (E Effect)</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The complete transfer of a shared pair of pi (π) electrons to one of the atoms joined by a multiple bond, <em>in the presence of an attacking reagent</em>.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>It's a <strong>temporary effect</strong>. The molecule reverts to its original state if the reagent is removed.</li>
                <li><strong>+E Effect:</strong> The π-electrons move towards the atom to which the attacking reagent (an electrophile) gets attached. (e.g., Addition of H⁺ to ethene).</li>
                <li><strong>-E Effect:</strong> The π-electrons move away from the atom to which the attacking reagent (a nucleophile) gets attached. (e.g., Addition of CN⁻ to propanone).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Resonance and Mesomeric Effect (R or M Effect)</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The delocalization (spreading out) of pi (π) electrons in a conjugated system (a system of alternating single and multiple bonds). The true structure is a "resonance hybrid" of all possible contributing "canonical" or "resonance" structures.
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Mesomeric effect</strong> is essentially the same as the resonance effect, but the term is specifically used to describe the effect of a substituent on the electron density of a conjugated system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>+M or +R Effect (Electron-donating):</strong> The group donates electrons to the conjugated system.
                    <br><strong>Example Groups:</strong> -OH, -OR, -NH₂, -Cl (Note: Halogens are -I but +M due to lone pairs).
                    <br><strong>Application:</strong> The -OH group in phenol activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution.
                </li>
                <li><strong>-M or -R Effect (Electron-withdrawing):</strong> The group withdraws electrons from the conjugated system.
                    <br><strong>Example Groups:</strong> -NO₂, -CN, -COOH, -CHO, -C=O.
                    <br><strong>Application:</strong> The -NO₂ group in nitrobenzene deactivates the ring.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember the hierarchy of electronic effects for determining reactivity: <strong>Resonance/Mesomeric > Hyperconjugation > Inductive</strong>. The Electromeric effect is temporary and only considered during the reaction mechanism.
            </div>

            <h3>Hyperconjugation (No-Bond Resonance)</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The delocalization of sigma (σ) electrons of a C-H bond (or C-C bond) into an adjacent empty or partially filled p-orbital or a π-orbital.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>It is also called the <strong>Baker-Nathan effect</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Requires at least one α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon *next* to the sp² carbon).</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Stability of Carbocations:</strong> More alkyl groups = more α-hydrogens = more hyperconjugation structures = more stability.
                            <br><strong>Order:</strong> 3° carbocation > 2° > 1° > Methyl.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Stability of Alkenes:</strong> More substituted alkenes are more stable (Saytzeff's Rule).
                            <br><strong>Order:</strong> Tetrasubstituted > Trisubstituted > Disubstituted > Monosubstituted.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

            <h2>Steric Effect</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The effect on reaction rates or molecular properties caused by the physical size of atoms or groups within a molecule.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steric Hindrance:</strong> When bulky groups physically block an attacking reagent from approaching a reaction site.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> The S<sub>N</sub>2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) reaction is fastest for primary (1°) alkyl halides and does not occur with tertiary (3°) alkyl halides. This is because the three bulky alkyl groups on a 3° carbon block the nucleophile from attacking.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Steric Strain:</strong> The increase in potential energy of a molecule due to non-bonded atoms or groups being forced too close to each other.</li>

            <h2>Bond Fission, Curly Arrows, and Formal Charges</h2>

            <h3>Homolytic and Heterolytic Fission</h3>
            <p>A covalent bond can break in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Homolytic Fission (Homolysis):</strong> The bond breaks symmetrically, with each atom taking one of the shared electrons. This generates <strong>free radicals</strong> (neutral species with an unpaired electron).
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> Cl-Cl --(UV light)--> Cl• + Cl•
                </li>
                <li><strong>Heterolytic Fission (Heterolysis):</strong> The bond breaks asymmetrically, with one atom taking *both* shared electrons. This generates <strong>ions</strong>.
                    <br><strong>Example 1:</strong> (CH₃)₃C-Br --> (CH₃)₃C⁺ (a carbocation) + Br⁻ (bromide ion)
                    <br><strong>Example 2:</strong> C-H bond in the presence of a strong base --> C⁻ (a carbanion) + H⁺
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Curly Arrow Rules</h3>
            <p>Curly arrows are used in reaction mechanisms to show the movement of electrons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>full-headed arrow (→)</strong> shows the movement of an electron *pair* (2 electrons). It starts from an electron-rich center (a lone pair or a bond) and points to an electron-deficient center (an atom or a new bond location).</li>
                <li>A <strong>half-headed or "fishhook" arrow (⇀)</strong> shows the movement of a *single* electron. It is used exclusively in free-radical mechanisms (homolytic fission).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Formal Charges</h3>
            <p>Formal charge is a "bookkeeping" tool to track electrons in Lewis structures. It helps determine which structure is most plausible.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Formula:</strong>
                <br>
                Formal Charge = (No. of Valence e⁻ in free atom) - (No. of non-bonding e⁻) - (1/2 * No. of bonding e⁻)
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The central N in the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).
                <br>It has 1 double bond and 2 single bonds (0 non-bonding e⁻, 8 bonding e⁻).
                <br>Valence e⁻ for N = 5.
                <br>Formal Charge = 5 - 0 - (1/2 * 8) = 5 - 4 = +1.</p>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> The sum of all formal charges on the atoms in a molecule or ion must equal the overall charge. For neutral molecules, the sum is zero.

            <h3>Electrophiles and Nucleophiles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electrophiles ("electron-loving"):</strong> Reagents that are electron-deficient. They attack areas of high electron density (like C=C bonds or lone pairs).
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Positive electrophiles:</strong> H⁺, Cl⁺, Br⁺, I⁺, NO₂⁺ (nitronium ion).</li>
                        <li><strong>Neutral electrophiles (incomplete octet):</strong> BF₃, AlCl₃ (Lewis acids).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nucleophiles ("nucleus-loving"):</strong> Reagents that are electron-rich. They donate an electron pair to form a new bond.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Negative nucleophiles:</strong> OH⁻ (hydroxide), CN⁻ (cyanide), Br⁻, H⁻.</li>
                        <li><strong>Neutral nucleophiles (lone pairs):</strong> H₂O, NH₃, R-OH (alcohols).</li>
                    </ul>

                <strong>Crucial for Exams:</strong> The stability order of carbocations, carbanions, and free radicals is one of the most frequently tested concepts. Understand *why* they are stable (hyperconjugation, inductive effect) and not just the order itself.
