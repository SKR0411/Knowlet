            <h2>Liquids: Viscosity</h2>
            
            <h3>Viscosity and Coefficient of Viscosity (η)</h3>
            <p><strong>Viscosity</strong> is the measure of a fluid's internal resistance to flow. It's often described as the "thickness" of a liquid (e.g., honey is more viscous than water).</p>
            <p>This resistance arises from the intermolecular forces within the liquid. Stronger forces lead to higher viscosity.</p>
            <p>The <strong>coefficient of viscosity (η)</strong> is defined as the force per unit area required to maintain a unit velocity gradient between two parallel layers of liquid.
            <blockquote>
                F = η · A · (dv/dx)
            </blockquote>
            <p>Where: <strong>F</strong> is the force, <strong>A</strong> is the area, and <strong>(dv/dx)</strong> is the velocity gradient.</p>

            <h3>Determination using Stalagmometer</h3>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Syllabus Error:</strong> The syllabus specifies determining viscosity using a "stalagmometer". This is incorrect. A stalagmometer is used for <strong>surface tension</strong>. Viscosity is measured using a <strong>viscometer</strong> (e.g., an Ostwald viscometer). The note below follows the correct instrumentation.
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Principle (using Ostwald Viscometer):</strong> Viscosity is measured *relatively* by comparing the time (t) it takes for a fixed volume of liquid to flow through a capillary tube, compared to a reference liquid (usually water) at the same temperature. This is based on <strong>Poiseuille's equation</strong>.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Working Formula:</strong>
                <br>
                η_1 / η_2 = (ρ_1 · t_1) / (ρ_2 · t_2)
            </blockquote>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>η_1, η_2</strong> = Viscosity of the unknown liquid and reference liquid (water)</li>
                <li><strong>ρ_1, ρ_2</strong> = Density of the unknown liquid and reference liquid</li>
                <li><strong>t_1, t_2</strong> = Time of flow for the unknown liquid and reference liquid</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Effect of Temperature</h3>
            <p>Viscosity <strong>decreases</strong> as temperature <strong>increases</strong>.
            <br>
            <strong>Reason:</strong> At higher temperatures, the molecules gain kinetic energy, which allows them to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction more easily, thus reducing the resistance to flow.</p>

            <h2>Liquids: Surface Tension</h2>
            
            <h3>Surface Tension and Coefficient of Surface Tension (γ)</h3>
            <p><strong>Surface tension</strong> is the tendency of a liquid to shrink into the minimum possible surface area (which is why drops are spherical). It's a property of the liquid's surface that causes it to behave like a stretched elastic membrane.</p>
            <p><strong>Reason:</strong> A molecule in the *bulk* of the liquid is attracted equally in all directions by its neighbors. A molecule at the *surface* has no neighbors above it, so it feels a net inward pull. This creates tension at the surface.</p>
            <p>The <strong>coefficient of surface tension (γ)</strong> is defined as the force acting per unit length of a line drawn on the liquid's surface.</p>
            
            <h3>Determination using Stalagmometer (Drop-Count Method)</h3>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> This method compares the number of drops (n) formed by a fixed volume (V) of a test liquid versus a reference liquid (water). The weight of a single drop (mg) is balanced by the surface tension (γ) acting on the circumference (2πr) of the capillary tip.</p>
            <p>mg = kγ
            <br>
            Since mass (m) = volume of one drop × density (ρ) = (V/n) × ρ
            <br>
            (V/n) · ρ · g = kγ</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Working Formula:</strong>
                <br>
                γ_1 / γ_2 = (ρ_1 / n_1) / (ρ_2 / n_2)
                <br>
                <strong>γ_1 = γ_2 · (ρ_1 / ρ_2) · (n_2 / n_1)</strong>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Where 1 is the unknown liquid and 2 is the reference (water).</p>
            <h3>Effect of Temperature</h3>
            <p>Surface tension <strong>decreases</strong> as temperature <strong>increases</strong>.
            <br>
            <strong>Reason:</strong> At higher temperatures, molecules have more kinetic energy, which weakens the intermolecular forces. The net inward pull on the surface molecules is reduced, so the surface tension drops.</p>

            <h3>Crystal Lattice and Unit Cell</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crystal Lattice (or Space Lattice):</strong> A regular 3D arrangement of points in space showing how the constituent particles are arranged.</li>
                <li><strong>Lattice Point:</strong> Each point in the lattice, representing one particle (atom, ion, or molecule).</li>
                <li><strong>Unit Cell:</strong> The <strong>smallest repeating unit</strong> of the crystal lattice. When repeated in three dimensions, it generates the entire crystal.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Types of Cubic Unit Cells</h3>
            <p>The simplest unit cells are cubic. There are three main types:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Simple Cubic (SC):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Particle positions:</strong> 8 at the corners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particles per unit cell (Z):</strong> 8 corners × (1/8 per corner) = <strong>1</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Particle positions:</strong> 8 at corners + 1 in the center.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particles per unit cell (Z):</strong> (8 × 1/8) + (1 × 1) = <strong>2</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Face-Centered Cubic (FCC):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Particle positions:</strong> 8 at corners + 6 in the center of faces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Particles per unit cell (Z):</strong> (8 × 1/8) + (6 × 1/2 per face) = 1 + 3 = <strong>4</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>X-ray Diffraction by Crystals (Bragg's Law)</h3>
            <p>The spacing between the layers of atoms in a crystal is too small to be seen with visible light. W.H. Bragg and W.L. Bragg showed that X-rays, which have wavelengths (λ) similar to the atomic spacing (d), can be diffracted by these layers.</p>
            <p>When X-rays hit the crystal, they are reflected by successive layers of atoms. Constructive interference (a bright spot) occurs only when the path difference between the waves reflected from adjacent layers is an integer multiple (n) of the wavelength.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Bragg's Law:</strong>
                <br>
                nλ = 2d sinθ
            </blockquote>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>n</strong> = Order of reflection (an integer: 1, 2, 3...)</li>
                <li><strong>λ</strong> = Wavelength of the X-rays</li>
                <li><strong>d</strong> = Interplanar spacing (distance between the layers)</li>
                <li><strong>θ</strong> = Glancing angle (angle of incidence)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By measuring the angles (θ) at which diffraction occurs, we can use Bragg's Law to calculate the distance (d) between the atomic layers, thus determining the crystal structure.</p>

            <h2>Defects in Crystals (Point Defects)</h2>
            <p>An ideal crystal is a perfect, repeating arrangement. However, real crystals always contain imperfections or <strong>defects</strong>. These defects are crucial as they control many properties (e.g., conductivity, color, mechanical strength).</p>
            <p><strong>Point Defects (Stoichiometric):</strong> These are imperfections at a single lattice point. They do *not* change the overall stoichiometry (ratio of ions) of the solid.</p>

            <h3>1. Schottky Defect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A pair of <strong>missing ions</strong>, one cation and one anion, from their lattice sites, creating a pair of vacancies.</li>
                <li><strong>How it forms:</strong> To maintain electrical neutrality, for every missing cation, there must be a missing anion.</li>
                <li><strong>Found in:</strong> Ionic solids where the cation and anion are of <strong>similar size</strong> (e.g., NaCl, KCl, CsCl).</li>
                <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Since particles are missing, the <strong>density of the crystal decreases</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Frenkel Defect (or Dislocation Defect)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A smaller ion (usually the <strong>cation</strong>) leaves its normal lattice site and moves into a small <strong>interstitial site</strong> (a gap between the normal sites).</li>
                <li><strong>How it forms:</strong> It creates a vacancy at its original site and an interstitial defect at its new site.</li>
                <li><strong>Found in:</strong> Ionic solids where there is a <strong>large difference in size</strong> between the cation and anion (e.g., AgCl, AgBr, ZnS).</li>
                <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Since no particles leave the crystal, the <strong>density remains unchanged</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Difference:</strong> Schottky = missing ions, density decreases. Frenkel = misplaced ion, density is unchanged.
