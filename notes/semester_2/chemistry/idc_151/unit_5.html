            <h2>Professor Har Govind Khorana (1922-2011)</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Contribution:</strong> Awarded the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968</strong> for his work on the "interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis."
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetic Code:</strong> After the genetic code (which uses 3-letter "words" or codons) was discovered, Khorana's work demonstrated how these codons are read by the cell to build proteins.</li>
                <li><strong>First Artificial Gene:</strong> His team achieved the <strong>world's first total synthesis of a gene</strong> (a yeast gene) in 1972, a landmark achievement in genetic engineering.</li>
                <li>He essentially proved how the DNA's instructions are translated into the proteins that make up a living organism.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Woman PhD in Science:</strong> She was the first woman to be awarded a Doctorate of Science from an Indian university (1944).</li>

            <h2>Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (b. 1952)</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Contribution:</strong> Awarded the <strong>Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009</strong> for "studies of the structure and function of the ribosome."
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Ribosome:</strong> The ribosome is the cell's "protein factory." It reads the genetic code (from mRNA) and assembles amino acids into long protein chains.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural Work:</strong> Using X-ray crystallography, Ramakrishnan and his team created a detailed, atom-level 3D map of the ribosome's smaller subunit (the 30S subunit).</li>
                <li>This work explained *how* the ribosome works so precisely, including how antibiotics bind to bacterial ribosomes and stop them (a key to designing new drugs).</li>
