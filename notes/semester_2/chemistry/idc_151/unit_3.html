            <h2>Glass Making</h2>
            <p>Glass is an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid. Ancient Indian glassmaking was a sophisticated art.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> The basic ingredients were <strong>silica</strong> (from sand, 'Valuka') and an alkali, usually <strong>soda ash</strong> ('Sarjika,' sodium carbonate) or potash, which acts as a flux to lower the melting point of silica.</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> These materials were fused together at very high temperatures in a furnace (Koshti Yantra).</li>
                <li><strong>Coloring:</strong> Ancient texts, like the *Brihatsamhita*, mention adding metal oxides to produce colored glass.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Copper Oxide:</strong> For blue-green glass.</li>
                        <li><strong>Iron Oxide:</strong> For green, brown, or amber glass.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manganese Oxide:</strong> For purple glass or to decolorize glass (remove green tint from iron).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Soap</h2>
            <p>Soap is a salt of a fatty acid, used for cleaning.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Saponification:</strong> The chemical reaction used to make soap. It involves heating a fat or oil (like castor oil or mahua oil) with a strong alkali (a base).
                <br><br>
                Fat/Oil (Triglyceride) + Alkali (e.g., Lye from wood ash) → Soap + Glycerol
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ancient texts describe the use of 'kshara' (alkali) derived from the ashes of specific plants (like the plantain tree) and 'taila' (oil) to produce foaming, cleansing substances.</p>

            <h2>Dyeing</h2>
            <p>India was known as the home of natural dyes for millennia. The processes involved a deep understanding of chemical interactions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Dyes:</strong> A wide range of colors was extracted from plants and insects.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indigo ('Nila'):</strong> A vibrant blue dye from the *Indigofera* plant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Madder ('Manjistha'):</strong> A red dye from the root of the madder plant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Turmeric ('Haridra'):</strong> A bright yellow dye from the turmeric root.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lac:</strong> A red dye from a species of scale insect.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mordants:</strong> A key chemical innovation. A mordant is a substance (like <strong>alum</strong>, 'sphatika') that acts as a bridge, binding the dye to the fabric fibres (like cotton), which would otherwise not hold the color. This process made the dyes bright and fast (resistant to washing).</li>

            <h2>Cosmetics and Perfumes</h2>
            <p>The use of cosmetics ('angaraga') and perfumes ('gandha') was highly developed in ancient India.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cosmetics:</strong> These were not just for beauty but also for hygiene and health.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Kohl ('Anjana'):</strong> Eyeliner made from soot (lampblack) or antimony sulfide, believed to protect the eyes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Saffron ('Kumkuma'):</strong> Used for facial-Glow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Henna ('Mehandi'):</strong> Used for dyeing hair and for temporary tattoos (skin decoration).</li>
                        <li><strong>Sandalwood ('Chandana'):</strong> Used as a cooling paste for the skin.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Perfumes ('Attar'):</strong>
                    <br>India mastered the art of <strong>steam distillation</strong> (using a Pātana Yantra) to extract essential oils and perfumes from flowers (like rose, jasmine) and other aromatic materials (like sandalwood). These were often stabilized in an oil base.

            <h2>Ink ('Masi')</h2>
            <p>The production of stable, permanent ink was crucial for writing sacred texts and manuscripts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Ink:</strong> The most common form. It was made by mixing <strong>soot (lampblack)</strong> with a binder like <strong>gum arabic</strong> or animal glue. This ink was very stable and resistant to fading.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron Gall Ink:</strong> A more advanced ink that becomes permanent. It was made by mixing <strong>tannic acid</strong> (from oak galls or other plants) with an iron salt (like ferrous sulfate). It writes as a light gray/brown and darkens to a deep black as it oxidizes on the paper.</li>

            <h2>Metallurgy</h2>
            <p>Ancient Indian metallurgy was world-renowned, especially in working with iron, steel, copper, and bronze.</p>
            
            <h3>Iron and Steel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delhi Iron Pillar:</strong> A 7-meter tall, 6-ton pillar from ~400 CE, located at the Qutub complex. Its remarkable
                <strong>corrosion resistance</strong> is a major metallurgical feat, attributed to a thin passive protective film of iron hydrogen phosphate hydrate (mishawite) on its surface.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Wootz Steel:</strong> A legendary high-carbon crucible steel produced in South India. It was famous for its hardness and sharp edge, and was exported to the Middle East, where it was used to make "Damascus blades." The process involved melting iron with carbon-rich materials in a sealed crucible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Copper and Bronze</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Copper:</strong> One of the first metals to be extracted and used. It was extracted from ores like chalcopyrite (copper iron sulfide).</li>
                <li><strong>Bronze:</strong> An alloy of copper and tin. It is harder than copper and has a lower melting point, making it ideal for casting.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost-Wax Casting (Cire Perdue):</strong> Ancient Indians mastered this technique to create intricate bronze statues (like the famous Chola bronzes).
                    <ol>
                        <li>A model is made from beeswax.</li>
                        <li>It is covered in clay, leaving small channels.</li>
                        <li>The clay is baked, hardening it and melting the wax, which runs out (hence "lost-wax").</li>
                        <li>Molten bronze is poured into the empty clay mold.</li>
                        <li>The mold is broken, revealing the finished bronze statue.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
