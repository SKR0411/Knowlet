            <h2>Sir Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray – Father of Indian Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray (1861-1944)</strong> is revered as the <strong>"Father of Indian Chemistry"</strong> for his foundational contributions as a scientist, teacher, and entrepreneur. He was a visionary who believed that India's future depended on its advancement in science and industry.</p>
            <p>He was a brilliant professor at Presidency College, Calcutta, where he inspired a generation of young scientists (including Satyendra Nath Bose and Meghnad Saha), establishing the first modern Indian school of chemical research.</p>

            <h2>Contributions in Chemical Research</h2>
            <p>P.C. Ray was a meticulous and gifted inorganic chemist. His most famous work centered on the study of nitrites, earning him the nickname "Master of Nitrites."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discovery of Mercurous Nitrite:</strong> In 1896, he achieved a major breakthrough by synthesizing a stable crystalline compound, <strong>mercurous nitrite (HgNO₂)</strong>. This was a challenging feat, as nitrites of heavy metals were known to be highly unstable.</li>
                <li><strong>Further Research:</strong> This discovery opened a new field. He and his students went on to synthesize and study a whole series of stable nitrites, including those of ammonia (Ammonium nitrite) and various organic amines.</li>
                <li><strong>"A History of Hindu Chemistry":</strong> Beyond the lab, Ray was a dedicated historian. He researched ancient Sanskrit texts and wrote a two-volume masterpiece, *A History of Hindu Chemistry*. This book proved to the world that India had a rich and advanced chemical heritage (Rasasastra, metallurgy) long before the modern era.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Development of Indian Chemical Industry</h2>
            <p>P.C. Ray was a fierce nationalist and believed in economic self-reliance (Swadeshi). He understood that political independence was meaningless without industrial and scientific independence.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works (BCPW)</strong>
                <br>
                In 1892, with limited capital (around ₹700), P.C. Ray started a small company in his home. This company, <strong>Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works</strong>, was India's <strong>first pharmaceutical company</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To create indigenous products, compete with British imports, and create jobs for Indian youth.</li>
                <li><strong>Products:</strong> BCPW started by manufacturing basic chemicals and medicines, such as sulfuric acid, and later expanded to produce a wide range of products including fire extinguishers, soaps, and hospital supplies.</li>
                <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> BCPW was a pioneering success that demonstrated the viability of Indian-owned science-based industry. It became a model for future industrial development in the country.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ray's Classification of Five Stages in Development of Chemistry in India</h2>
            <p>In his historical research, P.C. Ray classified the development of chemistry in India into five distinct periods. This classification provides a framework for understanding the evolution of chemical thought and practice on the subcontinent.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Pre-Vedic Stage (up to 1500 BCE):</strong> This period includes the Harappan Civilization. Evidence from this time shows practical chemical arts like baked pottery, bricks, and basic metallurgy (copper, bronze).</li>
                <li><strong>The Vedic and Ayurvedic Period (up to 700 CE):</strong> This stage saw the rise of Ayurveda, which used chemical preparations for medicine. It includes knowledge of fermentation (for drinks), dyeing, and the use of metals like gold and iron.</li>
                <li><strong>The Transitional Period (700 CE to 1100 CE):</strong> A period that saw the beginning of a shift from plant-based Ayurveda to mineral-based alchemy (Rasasastra).</li>
                <li><strong>The Tantric Period (700 CE to 1300 CE):</strong> This period is concurrent with the transitional period and marks the true rise of <strong>Rasasastra</strong> (Indian Alchemy). There was a heavy focus on mercury, sulfur, and the use of minerals for medicinal and alchemical purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>The Iatro-Chemical Period (1300 CE to 1600 CE):</strong> This is the "medical chemistry" period, where the primary focus of alchemy shifted decisively from transmuting metals to creating potent medicines (iatrochemistry) for curing diseases and promoting longevity.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> P.C. Ray's work showed that Indian chemistry did not just appear in the modern era; it had a deep, continuous, and logical development spanning millennia.
