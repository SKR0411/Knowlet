            <h2>4. Viva voce (Oral Examination)</h2>
            <p>The viva voce is a critical component of your practical exam. The examiner will ask you questions to assess your understanding of the experiments you performed. Marks are given for clear, confident, and correct answers.</p>
            
            <h3>What to Expect:</h3>
            <p>Questions will be based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The experiment you just performed:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What was the principle of your experiment?"</li>
                        <li>"Why did you add [a specific reagent, e.g., dilute H2SO4 in potash alum prep]?"</li>
                        <li>"What is the reaction involved in your preparation?"</li>
                        <li>"What is the formula for [the compound you made, e.g., chrome alum]?"</li>
                        <li>"What is the principle of recrystallization?"</li>
                        <li>"Why is a 2,4-DNP derivative colored?"</li>
                        <li>"What is the working formula for viscosity/surface tension?"</li>
                        <li>"What is a transition temperature?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Underlying Theory:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What is Molarity? What is Normality?"</li>
                        <li>"What is the n-factor of KMnO4 in acidic medium?"</li>
                        <li>"What is a double salt? What is a complex?" (e.g., Potash alum vs Sodium Trisoxalatochromate)</li>
                        <li>"What is a bidentate ligand? Give an example." (e.g., oxalate)</li>
                        <li>"Why is the melting point of an impure solid lower and broader?"</li>
                        <li>"What is a reducing sugar? Why is sucrose non-reducing?" (Relates to organic section)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Apparatus and Techniques:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What is this apparatus?" (e.g., Stalagmometer, Ostwald Viscometer)</li>
                        <li>"What is the purpose of calibration?"</li>
                        <li>"What precautions did you take while performing the experiment?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>How to Prepare for the Viva:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Understand, Don't Memorize:</strong> Don't just learn the procedure; understand *why* each step is done.</li>
                    <li><strong>Know Your Notebook:</strong> Review every experiment in your lab notebook. The examiner may ask questions directly from it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Honest:</strong> If you don't know an answer, it's better to say "I'm not sure, sir/ma'am" than to guess wildly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Confident:</strong> Speak clearly. Your practical work proves you can *do* the experiment; the viva proves you *understand* it.</li>

            <h2>5. Regularity in maintenance of Lab Note Book</h2>
            <p>Your lab notebook (practical record) is the official log of all your work throughout the semester. It is a major component of your internal assessment.</p>
            
            <h3>What makes a good Lab Notebook?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regularity & Completion:</strong> All experiments assigned during the semester must be present and signed by the instructor.</li>
                <li><strong>Neatness:</strong> It must be legible. Use a pen for records.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Every experiment should have a clear, consistent format:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Date</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Title / Aim of the Experiment</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Principle:</strong> A brief explanation of the theory.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> Chemical equations (for preparations).</li>
                        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Apparatus and chemicals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Step-by-step account of what you *did*.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observation / Observation Table:</strong> The raw data you collected (e.g., weights, time of flow, number of drops).</li>
                        <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> Show all your work clearly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Result:</strong> The final, clearly stated result (e.g., "The yield of chrome alum was 2.5 g", "The melting point of the derivative was 133-134°C", "The viscosity of the 10% solution was 1.05 cP").</li>
                        <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> 2-3 key points to ensure a good result.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Originality:</strong> Data should be your own. Calculations must be shown.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>For the Exam:</strong> Your notebook must be up-to-date, complete, and signed by your instructor. The external examiner will inspect it and base a significant portion of your marks on its quality and completeness.

            <h2>6. Attendance</h2>
            <p>A significant portion of the internal assessment is based on your regularity in attending the practical classes. Chemistry practicals are hands-on, and skills can only be built through consistent practice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marks are often awarded based on the percentage of practical classes you have attended throughout the semester.</li>
                <li>Missing classes means you have not performed those experiments, which will be reflected in your lab notebook and your ability to answer viva questions.</li>
