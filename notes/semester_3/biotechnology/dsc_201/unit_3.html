        <h2 id="gene-mutations">1. Gene Mutations</h2>
        
        <h3 id="def-types">Definition and Types of Mutations</h3>
        <p>A gene mutation is a sudden, heritable change in the **nucleotide sequence of DNA**.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Types of Mutations (Point Mutations):</strong> These involve changes to one or a few base pairs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base-pair Substitutions:</strong> Replacement of one nucleotide base with another.
                <ul>
                    <li>**Silent:** Changes a codon to a synonymous codon (same amino acid), having no effect on the protein.</li>
                    <li>**Missense:** Changes a codon to a codon for a different amino acid, altering the protein. (e.g., Sickle-cell anemia).</li>
                    <li>**Nonsense:** Changes a codon to a stop codon, resulting in a prematurely terminated (truncated) protein.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Frame-shift Mutations:</strong> Insertion or deletion of one or two nucleotides (not a multiple of three). This shifts the entire reading frame of the gene, radically changing the amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation and usually leading to a non-functional protein.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="causes">Causes of Mutations</h3>
        <p>Mutations can be classified as spontaneous or induced.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spontaneous Mutations:</strong> Occur naturally due to errors in DNA replication, metabolic byproducts (e.g., reactive oxygen species), or natural degradation processes (e.g., depurination).</li>
            <li><strong>Induced Mutations:</strong> Caused by environmental agents called **mutagens**.
                <ul>
                    <li>**Physical Mutagens:** Ionizing radiation (X-rays, Gamma rays) and non-ionizing radiation (UV light).</li>
                    <li>**Chemical Mutagens:** Base analogs, intercalating agents (cause frame-shifts), and chemicals that directly alter bases (e.g., alkylating agents).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="ames">Ames Test for Mutagenic Agents</h3>
        <p>The Ames test is a widely used biological assay to assess the **mutagenic potential of chemical compounds**.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A special strain of the bacterium <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em> is used. This strain is a **histidine auxotroph** (His<sup>-</sup>), meaning it cannot synthesize histidine and requires it in the medium.</li>
            <li>The test compound is added to a petri dish containing the His<sup>-</sup> bacteria and minimal medium (lacking histidine).</li>
            <li>The appearance of bacterial colonies (called **revertants**) indicates that the test chemical has mutated the bacteria back to the His<sup>+</sup> state (able to synthesize histidine).</li>
            <li>More revertant colonies compared to a control plate (no chemical) mean the chemical is a **mutagen**. Liver homogenate (S9 mix) is often added to mimic metabolic activation in the body.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="screening">Screening Procedures for Isolation of Mutants and Uses of Mutants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Screening Procedures:</strong> Methods used to identify or select organisms with a desired mutant phenotype.
                <ul>
                    <li>**Selection (Positive Screening):** Directly selecting for the desired mutant by killing off all non-mutants (e.g., plating antibiotic-resistant bacteria on an antibiotic-containing medium).</li>
                    <li>**Screening (Negative Screening):** Identifying the mutant from a pool of non-mutants (e.g., Replica plating for identifying nutritional auxotrophs).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uses of Mutants:</strong> Mutants are invaluable tools in research and industry.
                <ul>
                    <li>**Biotechnology:** Creating industrial strains (e.g., microbes producing higher yields of antibiotics, enzymes, or amino acids).</li>
                    <li>**Research:** Understanding gene function (e.g., identifying genes involved in a metabolic pathway by isolating pathway mutants).</li>
                    <li>**Agriculture:** Generating improved crop varieties (e.g., better yield, disease resistance) through mutation breeding.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="chromosomal-variation">2. Variations in Chromosome Structure (Chromosomal Aberrations)</h2>
        <p>These involve changes to the structure of chromosomes, typically affecting large segments of DNA.</p>
        
        <h3 id="deletion">Deletion</h3>
        <p>The loss of a segment of a chromosome.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> The loss of genetic material. If a vital gene is deleted, it is often lethal.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> **Cri-du-chat syndrome** (often mentioned with Monosomy 5 in the syllabus context) is caused by a terminal deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="duplication">Duplication</h3>
        <p>The repetition of a segment of a chromosome.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> The presence of extra genetic material. While often less harmful than deletion, it can still disrupt gene dosage, leading to abnormal development.</li>
            <li><strong>Evolutionary Role:</strong> Duplication is a major source of raw material for evolution, allowing one copy of a gene to evolve a new function while the other retains the original function.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="inversion">Inversion</h3>
        <p>A segment of a chromosome is removed, flipped 180 degrees, and reinserted back into the same location.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Types:** **Pericentric** (includes the centromere) and **Paracentric** (does not include the centromere).</li>
            <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> The linear order of genes is changed, which can lead to problems during meiosis (e.g., formation of non-viable gametes) but often has no phenotypic effect on the carrier.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="translocation">Translocation</h3>
        <p>A segment of one chromosome moves to a different, non-homologous chromosome.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Reciprocal Translocation:** Segments are exchanged between two non-homologous chromosomes (most common).</li>
            <li>**Consequence:** Can lead to cancer (e.g., Philadelphia chromosome in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) or cause issues in gamete formation, leading to reduced fertility or abnormal offspring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="chromosomal-abnormalities">3. Chromosomal Abnormalities in Human Beings</h2>
        <p>These typically involve **Aneuploidy**—a variation in the number of individual chromosomes, usually caused by non-disjunction during meiosis.</p>
        
        <h3 id="autosome">Aneuploidies of the Autosomes (Non-sex Chromosomes)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monosomy 5 (Cri-du-chat Syndrome):</strong> Karyotype is 46, XX or XY, 5p-. Although technically a large deletion, it is considered a major chromosomal abnormality. Causes severe intellectual disability and a characteristic cat-like cry.</li>
            <li><strong>Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome):</strong> Karyotype is 47, XX or XY, +13. Associated with severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, cleft lip/palate, polydactyly, and heart defects. Survival beyond the first year is rare.</li>
            <li><strong>Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome):</strong> Karyotype is 47, XX or XY, +18. Associated with severe intellectual disability, low-set ears, clenched hands, and heart defects. Life expectancy is often very short.</li>
            <li><strong>Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome):</strong> Karyotype is 47, XX or XY, +21. The most common autosomal trisomy. Characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and increased risk of heart defects.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="sex">Aneuploidies of the Sex Chromosome</h3>
        <p>These often have milder phenotypic effects because one X chromosome is inactivated (Barr body formation) and the Y chromosome has relatively few genes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turner Syndrome:</strong> Karyotype is **45, X0** (Monosomy X). Affects females. Characterized by short stature, webbed neck, sterility (non-functional ovaries), and lack of secondary sexual characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Klinefelter Syndrome:</strong> Karyotype is **47, XXY**. Affects males. Characterized by tall stature, sterility, presence of some female characteristics (gynecomastia), and often mild learning difficulties.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <blockquote class="exam-tip">
            **Barr Bodies:** An inactivated X chromosome found in the somatic cells of mammalian females. The number of Barr Bodies is calculated as: **Number of X chromosomes - 1**.
            <ul>
                <li>Normal female (XX): 1 Barr body.</li>
                <li>Normal male (XY): 0 Barr bodies.</li>
                <li>Turner Syndrome (X0): 0 Barr bodies.</li>
                <li>Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY): 1 Barr body.</li>
            </ul>
