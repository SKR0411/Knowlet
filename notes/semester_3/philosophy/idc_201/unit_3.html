        <h2 id="toc_3_1">Gender Issues in Health</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_3_1_health_issues">Gender issues in health relate to disparities in access, treatment, research, and outcomes for different genders, often stemming from gender bias in medical practice and societal roles</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Ethical Problems in Health</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Diagnostic Bias:** Women’s symptoms are sometimes misdiagnosed or dismissed as psychological more frequently than men’s, particularly regarding heart disease or chronic pain.</li>
            <li>**Reproductive Rights:** Ethical and policy debates surrounding **abortion** and **euthanasia** (as discussed in Applied Ethics) often center on women's bodily autonomy and decision-making power.</li>
            <li>**Underrepresentation in Research:** Historically, medical drug trials and research cohorts were male-centric, leading to gaps in understanding gender-specific health effects.</li>
            <li>**Access to Care:** In many regions, women and girls face barriers to accessing essential services like nutritional care, maternal healthcare, and mental health support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_3_2">Gender Issues in Education</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_3_2_education_issues">Gender issues in education focus on equal access, retention, curriculum bias, and outcomes, recognizing that education is a fundamental human right necessary for self-development</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Ethical Problems in Education</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Access and Retention:** In many developing contexts, girls are disproportionately excluded from primary and secondary education due to domestic responsibilities or safety concerns.</li>
            <li>**Curriculum Bias:** Textbooks and historical narratives often marginalize the contributions and experiences of women, reinforcing gender stereotypes.</li>
            <li>**Subject Segregation:** The persistence of gender stereotypes in subject choice (e.g., discouraging girls from STEM fields) limits professional opportunities later in life.</li>
            <li>**Safety and Environment:** Harassment or unsafe conditions in schools can disproportionately affect girls' attendance and educational quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_3_3">Gender Issues in Governance</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_3_3_governance_issues">Governance concerns relate to the representation of women in political and decision-making bodies, the gender neutrality of laws, and the fairness of policy implementation</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Ethical Problems in Governance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Political Representation:** The underrepresentation of women in parliaments, cabinets, and judicial bodies leads to policies that may neglect or insufficiently address gender-specific needs.</li>
            <li>**Gender-Biased Laws:** Laws related to property inheritance, divorce, and personal safety (e.g., domestic violence protection) may implicitly or explicitly favor male interests due to ingrained **patriarchal** structures.</li>
            <li>**Policy Implementation:** Even gender-neutral policies (e.g., welfare distribution) can have disproportionately negative effects on women if societal structures (e.g., lack of childcare, mobility issues) are ignored.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="exam-tip"><strong>Ethical Principle: Justice</strong></p>
        <p>The core ethical defense against all these issues is the principle of **Distributive Justice**, which demands that benefits (health, education, power) and burdens be distributed fairly across all genders, dismantling the systems that enforce current biases.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaway for Unit 3:</h3>
            <p>Gender issues are systemic, manifesting not only in personal biases but in institutional failures across **Health, Education, and Governance**. Be ready to provide specific examples of **bias** in each domain (e.g., medical research bias, curriculum bias, low political representation).</p>
