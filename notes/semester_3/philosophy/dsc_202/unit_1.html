        <h2 id="toc_1_1">Primacy of Logical Reasoning</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_1_1_primacy">In Indian Philosophy, especially the Nyaya school, **Anumāna** (inference) is considered one of the most important sources of valid knowledge (**Pramāna**), second only to direct perception (**Pratyaksa**)</span>. Its primacy lies in its ability to generate knowledge about objects or events that are beyond the immediate reach of the senses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> It is the logical bridge from the observed (the smoke on the hill) to the unobserved (the fire on the hill).</li>
            <li><strong>Basis:</strong> Anumāna is fundamentally built on the relation of **Vyāpti** (universal concomitance), making its structure highly deductive and rigorous.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_1_2">Anumāna: Definition, Constitution, Process and Types</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_1_2_anumana_def">**Anumāna** literally means 'after-knowledge' (Anu = after, Mana = knowledge)</span>. It is the knowledge of an object due to previous knowledge, specifically the knowledge of the **hetu** (reason) as invariably related to the **sādhya** (major term) and existing in the **pakṣa** (minor term).</p>

        <h3>Constitution of Anumāna (The Three Terms)</h3>
        <p>Anumāna involves three terms, similar to the major, minor, and middle terms of Western Syllogism, but structured based on relationship to Vyāpti:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pakşa (Minor Term):</strong> The subject of the inference. The locus where the property is inferred (e.g., The Hill).</li>
            <li><strong>Sādhya (Major Term):</strong> The property to be inferred or proved (e.g., Fire).</li>
            <li><strong>Hetu (Middle Term/Reason/Mark):</strong> The sign or reason that leads to the inference. It is what is present in the Pakşa and invariably connected to the Sādhya (e.g., Smoke).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>The Five-Membered Syllogism (Pañcāvayava)</h3>
        <p><span id="spap_1_2_pancavayava">The Nyaya school uses a five-membered statement of inference, considered necessary for convincing others (Parārthānumāna)</span>. This contrasts with Western syllogism, which is three-membered.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pratijñā (Thesis/Proposition):</strong> The statement to be proved (The hill has fire).</li>
            <li><strong>Hetu (Reason):</strong> Statement of the reason (Because it has smoke).</li>
            <li><strong>Udāharana (Example):</strong> Statement of universal concomitance (Vyāpti) coupled with an example (Wherever there is smoke, there is fire, like in a kitchen hearth).</li>
            <li><strong>Upanaya (Application):</strong> Application of the universal concomitance to the subject (This hill has smoke which is invariably connected with fire).</li>
            <li><strong>Nigamana (Conclusion):</strong> The final conclusion (Therefore, the hill has fire).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Types of Anumāna (Based on the Method of Inference)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pūrvavat:</strong> Inferring an effect from a perceived cause (e.g., inferring future rain from thick clouds).</li>
            <li><strong>Śeṣavat:</strong> Inferring a cause from a perceived effect (e.g., inferring past rain upstream from the present swiftness of the river water).</li>
            <li><strong>Sāmānyatodṛṣta:</strong> Inferring something that is not directly observable based on general experience (e.g., inferring the existence of the sun’s motion because we see its change of place, even though the motion itself is not seen).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_1_3">Pakşatā, Parāmarśa and Vyāpti</h2>
        <p>These are the three crucial conceptual pillars for valid inference in Nyaya.</p>

        <h3>Vyāpti (Universal Concomitance)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p><span id="spap_1_3_vyapti_def"><strong>Vyāpti</strong> is the universal and unconditional relation of concomitance between the Hetu (middle term/smoke) and the Sādhya (major term/fire)</span>. It is the backbone of Anumāna.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> It is an invariable relation (necessity), where the Sādhya must be present wherever the Hetu is present.</li>
            <li><strong>Unconditionality:</strong> It must be free from any limiting condition (**Upādhi**). Example: Smoke is related to fire unconditionally, but the relation "smoke is present wherever wet wood fire is present" is conditioned by wet wood.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pakşatā (Condition of the Minor Term)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p><span id="spap_1_3_paksata_def"><strong>Pakşatā</strong> is the desire to prove the Sādhya in the Pakşa (subject), provided the Sādhya is currently unknown in that Pakşa</span>. It signifies the uncertainty or doubt that motivates the inference.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>If you already know the hill has fire, there is no **Pakşatā** and thus no valid inference (Anumāna) can occur.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Parāmarśa (The Final Act of Inference)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p><span id="spap_1_3_paramarsa_def"><strong>Parāmarśa</strong> is the knowledge of the **Hetu** (smoke) existing in the **Pakşa** (hill), which is characterized by **Vyāpti** with the **Sādhya** (fire)</span>. It is the final mental synthesis that immediately precedes the conclusion.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Process Flow:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>See smoke (**Hetu**) on the hill (**Pakşa**).</li>
            <li>Recall Vyāpti (Wherever there is smoke, there is fire).</li>
            <li>**Parāmarśa:** The knowledge that "This hill has smoke, which is invariably accompanied by fire."</li>
            <li><strong>Anumāna:</strong> Inference that "The hill has fire."</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="exam-tip"><strong>Exam Tip: Key Distinctions</strong></p>
        <p>The **Vyāpti** is the objective, universal relation. The **Parāmarśa** is the subjective, final cognitive step that applies that relation to the immediate case, triggering the inference.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaway for Unit 1:</h3>
            <p>Master the five members of the **Pañcāvayava** and the definitions of the three concepts: **Vyāpti** (invariable connection), **Pakşatā** (desire to know in the subject), and **Parāmarśa** (knowledge of the *Hetu* in the *Pakşa* qualified by *Vyāpti*).</p>
