        <h2 id="toc_5_1">Probability: The Theories</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_1_probability_def">**Probability** is a concept in Inductive Logic that measures the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certainty)</span>. It provides a formal framework for evaluating inductive arguments, which are inherently uncertain.</p>
        
        <h3>The Classical (A Priori) View</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Definition:** Probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of equally possible outcomes.</li>
            <li>**Formula:** <span id="spap_5_1_classical_formula">P(A) = Favorable Outcomes / Total Possible Outcomes</span>.</li>
            <li>**Limitation:** It is limited to cases where outcomes are known and are equally likely (e.g., dice, coins).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Frequency (A Posteriori) View</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Definition:** Probability is the ratio of the number of times an event occurs in a series of trials to the total number of trials, as the number of trials increases indefinitely.</li>
            <li>**Formula:** <span id="spap_5_1_frequency_formula">P(A) = Number of times A occurred / Total Number of trials</span>.</li>
            <li>**Application:** Used for insurance, medical statistics, and long-term predictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_5_2">Theories of Addition and Multiplication</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_2_probability_theories">These rules calculate the probability of complex events based on the probabilities of their simple component events</span>.</p>

        <h3>1. Addition Theorem (For 'OR' events)</h3>
        <p>This calculates the probability of *at least one* of two events occurring (P(A or B)).</p>
        
        <p><strong>A. Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> Events that cannot occur at the same time (e.g., flipping heads OR tails).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <span id="spap_5_2_addition_exclusive_formula">P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</span></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>B. Non-Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> Events that can occur at the same time (e.g., drawing an Ace OR a Spade from a deck).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <span id="spap_5_2_addition_inclusive_formula">P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</span> (Subtracts the probability of the overlap)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>2. Multiplication Theorem (For 'AND' events)</h3>
        <p>This calculates the probability of two events occurring in sequence (P(A and B)).</p>
        
        <p><strong>A. Independent Events:</strong> The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other (e.g., flipping a coin twice).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <span id="spap_5_2_multiplication_independent_formula">P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)</span></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>B. Dependent Events:</strong> The occurrence of the first event *does* affect the probability of the second (e.g., drawing two cards without replacement).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <span id="spap_5_2_multiplication_dependent_formula">P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)</span> (Where P(B | A) is the probability of B given that A has already occurred)</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p class="exam-tip"><strong>Exam Tip: Calculate and Apply</strong></p>
        <p>You must be able to solve numerical problems using these four formulas. The key is correctly identifying if the events are **Mutually Exclusive/Inclusive** for addition, and **Independent/Dependent** for multiplication.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_5_3">Mill's Method of Experimental Enquiry</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_3_mills_methods">John Stuart Mill formulated five canons (methods) to systematically determine causal relationships from observed phenomena. These methods are foundational to modern experimental induction</span>.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaway for Unit 5:</h3>
            <p>For Probability, know the conditions for using the **four formulas**. For Mill's Methods, be able to **define** each method and provide a **distinct real-world example** that perfectly illustrates its principle, focusing especially on the structure of Agreement and Difference.</p>
