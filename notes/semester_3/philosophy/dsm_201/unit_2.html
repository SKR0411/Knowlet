        <h2 id="toc_2_1">Plato: The Socratic Influence</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_2_1_socratic_influence">Plato's philosophy is fundamentally shaped by his teacher, **Socrates**, particularly his search for **universal definitions** of ethical concepts like Justice, Goodness, and Virtue</span>. This search for stable, objective knowledge about moral reality is the precursor to Plato's Theory of Ideas.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>**Socratic Method:** The use of dialectic (question-and-answer) to expose contradictions and move toward clear, universal definitions.</li>
            <li>**Knowledge is Virtue:** The Socratic belief that genuine knowledge of the Good must lead to good action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_2_2">Plato: Theory of Knowledge and Ideas</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_2_2_plato_ideas">Plato's **Theory of Ideas (or Forms)** is his core metaphysical and epistemological doctrine</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Metaphysics: The World of Forms</h3>
        <p>Plato posits two distinct realms of existence:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>World of Forms (Ideas):</strong> The realm of perfect, eternal, immutable, non-physical blueprints of everything that exists (e.g., the Form of Justice, the Form of Beauty, the Form of Horseness). These are **fully real**.</li>
            <li><strong>World of Sensory Experience:</strong> The physical, changing, imperfect, temporary world we perceive. These are merely **copies** or **participations** of the Forms.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Epistemology: Knowledge vs. Opinion</h3>
        <p>Knowledge (**Episteme**) is certain, universal, and non-contradictory. It can only be directed toward the eternal, non-changing Forms. Opinion (**Doxa**) is uncertain, relative, and directed toward the changing physical world.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Allegory of the Cave:</strong> The prisoners mistake shadows (sensory experience) for reality. True knowledge requires turning toward the light (the Forms).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="toc_2_3">Aristotle: Critique of Plato</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_2_3_aristotle_critique">Aristotle, Plato's student, agreed that Forms were essential but criticized their separation from the physical world</span>. He argued that placing the Forms in a transcendent realm (the World of Ideas) makes them irrelevant to understanding the concrete objects of experience.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>**The Third Man Argument:** Aristotle argued that if a Form (F) is needed to explain the common property of a group of things (A, B, C), then a third, higher Form (F2) would be needed to explain the common property shared by F, A, B, and C, leading to an infinite regress.</li>
            <li>**Immanence over Transcendence:** For Aristotle, the Form of a horse is not in another world; it is *in* every particular horse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_2_4">Aristotle: Form and Matter</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_2_4_form_matter">Aristotle's metaphysics is based on the co-principles of **Form** and **Matter** (**Hylomorphism**)</span>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matter (*Hyle*):</strong> The **potential** stuff of which a thing is made. It is indeterminate and passive (e.g., wood, marble).</li>
            <li><strong>Form (*Morphe*):</strong> The **actual** structure, essence, or defining organization of a thing. It is what makes the matter *this* particular thing (e.g., the shape of the statue, the structure of the horse).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="exam-tip"><strong>Unity:</strong> Unlike Plato, Aristotle argued that Form and Matter are inseparable in concrete objects (except for pure God, who is Form without Matter, and Prime Matter, which is Matter without Form).</p>

        <h2 id="toc_2_5">Aristotle: Causation (Four Causes)</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_2_5_causation_def">Aristotle developed a systematic framework to explain **change** and **existence** by identifying **Four Causes** that must be answered to fully understand any object or event</span>.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Material Cause (What is it made of?):</strong> The substance or matter from which a thing comes to be (e.g., Bronze of a statue).</li>
            <li><strong>Formal Cause (What is the pattern?):</strong> The shape, structure, essence, or definition of the thing (e.g., The plan or design of the statue).</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Cause (What makes it happen?):</strong> The primary source of the change or movement; the agent (e.g., The sculptor who physically creates the statue).</li>
            <li><strong>Final Cause (What is its purpose?):</strong> The end, goal, or purpose for which a thing exists (e.g., The purpose of the statue—to honor a hero).</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="exam-tip"><strong>Exam Focus: Defining the Four Causes</strong></p>
        <p>Ensure you can define the four causes using the example of a **House** or a **Statue**. The **Final Cause** (teleology) is most characteristic of Aristotle's worldview.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaway for Unit 2:</h3>
            <p>Master the contrast: **Plato** separates Form and Matter (transcendent), leading to certain knowledge. **Aristotle** unites Form and Matter (immanent), leading to empirical knowledge and the four causal explanations for change.</p>
