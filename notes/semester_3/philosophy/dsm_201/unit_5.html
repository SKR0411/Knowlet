        <h2 id="toc_5_1">Substance</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_1_substance_def">**Substance** is a core metaphysical category. It is defined as that which exists in itself and needs nothing else in which to exist, and is the underlying reality that possesses **attributes** or **properties**</span>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>**Descartes:** Proposed three substances: God (infinite), Mind (thinking, unextended), and Matter (extended, non-thinking).</li>
            <li>**Spinoza:** Argued that only **God** is Substance (since only God is truly self-caused and self-sufficient—Monism). Mind and Matter are merely two **Attributes** of this single Substance.</li>
            <li>**Locke:** Defined substance as an **unknown substratum** or "something I know not what" that holds all the perceived qualities together.</li>
            <li>**Hume:** Reduced substance to merely a **collection of ideas** connected by imagination, denying its objective metaphysical reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_5_2">Space and Time</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_2_space_time_def">Space and Time are fundamental frameworks within which all experience takes place</span>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>**Newton/Classical View (Absolute):** Space and Time exist independently of the objects within them. They are infinite, fixed, and unchanging containers.</li>
            <li>**Leibniz (Relational):** Space and Time are not things, but merely systems of relations between objects and events. If there were no objects, there would be no space or time.</li>
            <li>**Kant (Transcendental Idealist):** Space and Time are **a priori forms of intuition**. They are not properties of things-in-themselves (*Noumena*), but are the necessary subjective lenses (*Phenomena*) through which the human mind organizes sensory experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_5_3">Universals (The Problem of Universals)</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_3_universals_def">**Universals** are those properties, features, or essences that can be instantiated by many particular things (e.g., *redness*, *horseness*, *justice*)</span>. The problem of universals asks: do universals exist, and if so, what is their nature and location?</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Platonic Realism (Extreme Realism):</strong> Universals exist **objectively** and **prior to** (or separate from) particulars (e.g., the Form of Justice exists in the World of Forms).</li>
            <li><strong>Aristotelian Realism (Moderate Realism):</strong> Universals exist **objectively** but **in** (immanent to) the particulars, not separate from them.</li>
            <li><strong>Nominalism:</strong> Universals do **not** exist. They are merely names, concepts, or labels we use to group similar things together. Only particulars are real.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="toc_5_4">Causality (David Hume)</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_5_4_hume_causality_def">David Hume, through his Empiricist lens, delivered a severe challenge to the traditional metaphysical category of **Causality** (the necessary connection between a cause and its effect)</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Hume's Analysis</h3>
        <p>Hume asked: where is the **necessary connection** perceived? He found only three factors in any causal relation (A causes B):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>**Contiguity:** A and B occur close in space and time.</li>
            <li>**Priority:** A occurs immediately before B.</li>
            <li>**Constant Conjunction:** A has always been followed by B in past experience.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Hume concluded that the idea of **Necessary Connection** is not derived from any objective impression in the external world. Instead, it is merely a **habit of mind** (or psychological expectation) projected onto the world, derived from the frequent observation of constant conjunction.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Causality is not a metaphysical necessity but a **psychological necessity** based on repeated custom. This conclusion led to Kant's Critical philosophy, which sought to save causality as an *a priori* condition of experience.</p>
        </blockquote>

            <h3>Key Takeaway for Unit 5:</h3>
            <p>Focus on the **Humean skepticism** regarding causality—the most radical empiricist attack on a fundamental metaphysical category. Also, clearly state the three positions on **Universals** (Platonic Realism, Aristotelian Realism, Nominalism).</p>
