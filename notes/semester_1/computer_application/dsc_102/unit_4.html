    <h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts of Tree</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>In discrete mathematics, a <strong>tree</strong> is a connected graph that contains no circuits (cycles)[cite: 59, 77]. It is one of the most important structures used to represent hierarchical relationships.</p>

    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Connectedness</strong>: There is a path between every pair of vertices[cite: 59, 77].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Acyclic</strong>: There are no loops or closed paths in the structure[cite: 59, 77].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="properties">Properties of Trees</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Trees have several mathematical properties that distinguish them from other types of graphs[cite: 59, 77]:</p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Edge-Vertex Relationship</strong>: A tree with <em>n</em> vertices always has exactly <em>n - 1</em> edges[cite: 59, 77].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Unique Path</strong>: There is exactly one unique path between any two vertices in a tree[cite: 59, 77].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Minimally Connected</strong>: Removing any edge from a tree results in a disconnected graph (it becomes a "forest")[cite: 59, 77].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="vertices-centre">Pendant Vertices and Centre of a Tree</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Special vertices in a tree help define its structure and shape[cite: 59, 77].</p>
    
    <h3>Pendant Vertices</h3>
    [cite_start]<p>A <strong>pendant vertex</strong> (also known as a leaf) is a vertex of degree 1[cite: 59, 77]. [cite_start]Every tree with more than one vertex has at least two pendant vertices[cite: 59, 77].</p>

    <h3>Centre of a Tree</h3>
    [cite_start]<p>The <strong>centre</strong> of a tree consists of one or two vertices that have the minimum maximum distance to all other vertices in the tree[cite: 59, 77]. [cite_start]This is found by repeatedly removing all pendant vertices until only one or two remain[cite: 59, 77].</p>

    <h2 id="binary-trees">Rooted Binary Trees</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>A <strong>rooted tree</strong> is a tree in which one specific vertex is designated as the root[cite: 59, 77].</p>
    
    

    <h3>Rooted Binary Tree</h3>
    [cite_start]<p>A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a rooted tree where every internal vertex has at most two children[cite: 59, 77]. [cite_start]Each child is typically designated as either a "left child" or a "right child"[cite: 59, 77].</p>

    <h2 id="extended-trees">Complete and Extended Binary Trees</h2>
    [cite_start]<p>Depending on how the nodes are filled, binary trees are categorized into specific types[cite: 59, 77]:</p>
    <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Complete Binary Tree</strong>: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible[cite: 59, 77].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Extended Binary Tree</strong>: Also known as a 2-tree, it is a binary tree where every node has either zero or two children[cite: 59, 77]. [cite_start]Empty spots are often represented by special "external nodes"[cite: 59, 77].</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Exam Focus & Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember the formula <strong>Edges = V - 1</strong>. [cite_start]If a question asks for edges in a tree with 15 vertices, the answer is 14[cite: 59, 77].</li>
            <li><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Confusing a general tree with a binary tree. [cite_start]A general tree can have any number of children per node, whereas a binary tree is limited to two[cite: 59, 77].</li>
            [cite_start]<li><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> <strong>"No Cycles, No Problems"</strong> - A tree must never have a loop[cite: 59, 77].</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: What is a pendant vertex?</strong><br>
        [cite_start]A: A vertex with a degree of 1, effectively a "leaf" of the tree[cite: 59, 77].</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How many roots does a rooted tree have?</strong><br>
        [cite_start]A: Exactly one[cite: 59, 77].</p>
