        <h2 id="topic1">Concept of Substance</h2>
        <p><strong>Substance</strong> is one of the most central and disputed concepts in metaphysics. It refers to the "ultimate stuff" of reality, the fundamental "thing" that "stands under" (<em>sub-stare</em>) and supports all of an object's properties.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_22"><strong>Substance</strong> is traditionally defined as that which can exist *independently* on its own, and which persists through change.</span> It is the "owner" of properties (qualities, attributes).
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Example: An Apple</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>We perceive its *properties*: "red," "round," "sweet," "hard."</li>
            <li>But what is the "it" that *has* these properties? We call this "it" the <strong>substance</strong>.</li>
            <li>The properties can change (the apple can become "brown" and "soft"), but we still assume the underlying "substance" (the apple itself) remains the same.</li>
        </ul>

                    <td><strong>Locke (Empiricist)</strong></td>

                    <td><strong>Rejects substance.</strong> Since all knowledge is from experience, and we only ever experience a "bundle" of properties (red, sweet, round), we have no basis for believing in an *extra* "thing" called substance. "Substance" is just a word we use for this bundle.</td>

        <h2 id="topic2">Concept of Space</h2>
        <p>What is space? Is it a "thing" in itself, or just a "relationship" between things?</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute View (Newton):</strong> Space is like a giant, invisible, empty "container" or "stage." It is absolute, real, and exists independently of any objects in it. Objects are *in* space, and space would still exist even if all objects were removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Relational View (Leibniz):</strong> Space is *not* a "thing." It is merely a *set of relations* between objects. "Space" is just a way of describing distances and directions (e.g., "to the left of," "five feet from"). If there were no objects, there would be no relations, and thus no "space."</li>
            <li><strong>Kantian View (Kant):</strong> Space is neither a thing nor a relation "out there." It is a fundamental "form of intuition"—an "inner goggle" of the human mind. We are "hard-wired" to perceive all *external* objects as existing *in* space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Concept of Time</h2>
        <p>What is time? This concept is deeply linked to the concept of space.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute View (Newton):</strong> Time is like a giant, invisible "river" that "flows" at a constant rate, everywhere in the universe. It is absolute, real, and exists independently of any events that happen *in* it.</li>
            <li><strong>Relational View (Leibniz):</strong> Time is *not* a "thing." It is merely a *set of relations* between events. "Time" is just a way of describing the order of events (e.g., "before," "after," "simultaneously"). If nothing ever changed or happened, there would be no "time."</li>
            <li><strong>Kantian View (Kant):</strong> Time is the *other* "form of intuition." It is the "inner goggle" through which we experience all *internal* states (our thoughts, feelings) and *also* order all external events.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember Kant's pairing.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Space</strong> = The mind's form for all <strong>outer</strong> sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Time</strong> = The mind's form for all <strong>inner</strong> sense (and by extension, all sense).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="topic4">Concept of Causality (Hume)</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most famous and important arguments in modern philosophy. The syllabus specifically points to <strong>David Hume</strong>, the radical empiricist.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Question:</strong> What is causality (cause and effect)? When we say "A causes B" (e.g., "The cue ball hitting the 8-ball *causes* it to move"), what do we actually *know*?</p>
        <p>Before Hume, philosophers (like Rationalists) believed that causality was a "necessary connection." They thought there was a real, logical, and necessary "force" or "power" in the cause (A) that *made* the effect (B) happen.</p>

        <h3 id="topic4_1">Hume's Critique of Causality</h3>
        <p>Hume, as a strict empiricist, applies his test: "If all knowledge comes from experience (impressions), show me the *impression* of causality."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hume's Analysis:</strong>
        When we observe a "causal" event (like one billiard ball hitting another), what do we *actually* see?</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Contiguity (in Space and Time):</strong> We see event A (the first ball moving) and event B (the second ball moving) happen next to each other, in an unbroken sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Priority (in Time):</strong> We see event A happen *before* event B.</li>
            <li><strong>Constant Conjunction:</strong> We have seen this *same sequence* happen over and over again in our past (e.g., every time one ball hits another, the second one moves).</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>The "Missing" Ingredient:</strong>
        Hume points out that no matter how hard we look, we *never* perceive the "cause" itself.
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_23">"We never have an impression of a <strong>'necessary connection,'</strong> a 'power,' or a 'force'</span> passing from ball A to ball B. We only see a *sequence* of events. We see A, *then* B."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Since we have no *impression* of a "necessary connection," we have no *knowledge* of a "necessary connection." The idea that causes *force* or *compel* their effects is a fiction. We cannot prove, either by reason or by experience, that any two events are necessarily linked.</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic4_2">Hume's Solution: Causality as Psychological Habit</h3>
        <p>So, if causality isn't "in the world," why do we believe in it so strongly? Hume gives a psychological explanation.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_24">Our belief in causality is not based on *reason* or *perception*, but on <strong>psychological habit</strong> (or "custom").</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li>After observing the "constant conjunction" of A and B thousands of times, our mind develops a "habit of association."</li>
            <li>When we see A happen again, our mind *automatically* and *instinctively* *expects* B to happen.</li>
            <li>We then (falsely) project this *internal feeling of expectation* onto the external world, and call it a "necessary connection."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Final Summary of Hume's View:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What causality *is* in the world:</strong> Just a "constant conjunction" of events.</li>
            <li><strong>What we *think* causality is:</strong> A "necessary connection."</li>
            <li><strong>Where this idea comes from:</strong> A "psychological habit" formed by observing this conjunction.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Hume's critique of causality is a powerful example of empiricist skepticism.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>He does not deny</strong> that there is a *regularity* in the world (e.g., the sun will "probably" rise tomorrow).</li>
                <li><strong>He *does* deny</strong> that we can be *rationally certain* that this regularity is "necessary" or that the sun *must* rise.</li>
                <li>This is the argument that "awakened" Kant and led him to develop his Critical Theory (Unit 3) to "save" causality by placing it *in the mind*.</li>
