        <h2 id="topic1">Meaning and Scope of Philosophy</h2>
        <p>This section introduces the fundamental nature of philosophy as an academic discipline.</p>

        <h3>Meaning of Philosophy</h3>
        <p>The word "Philosophy" comes from two Greek words:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philo:</strong> Meaning "Love"</li>
            <li><strong>Sophia:</strong> Meaning "Wisdom"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, <span id="spap_1"><strong>philosophy</strong> literally means "the love of wisdom."</span> It is a critical and systematic inquiry into the fundamental questions of existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.</p>
        <p>Unlike other disciplines that focus on a specific part of reality (like biology studies life, or physics studies matter), philosophy is a "second-order" discipline. It steps back and asks critical questions about the assumptions, methods, and concepts of all other disciplines (including itself).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Defining Philosophy:</strong> Philosophy is the rational, abstract, and methodical consideration of reality as a whole or of fundamental dimensions of human existence and experience.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Scope of Philosophy</h3>
        <p>The scope of philosophy is incredibly broad, as it seeks to ask the "big questions." Traditionally, its scope is divided into three main branches, which are covered in this unit:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Metaphysics:</strong> The study of reality and existence.</li>
            <li><strong>Epistemology:</strong> The study of knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Axiology:</strong> The study of value (including ethics and aesthetics).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Beyond these, philosophy also includes Logic (the study of correct reasoning), Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Language, Political Philosophy, and more. The scope is all-encompassing, as it can be the "philosophy of" any subject.</p>

        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder]</strong>

        </div>

        <h2 id="topic2">Metaphysics</h2>
        <p><strong>Metaphysics</strong> is the branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental nature of reality, existence, and the world. It seeks to answer the question, "What is there?"</s_pan></p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_2">The name comes from its place in Aristotle's works, which came "after" (<em>meta</em>) his works on "physics" (<em>physika</em>).</span> It deals with concepts that are beyond the physical world, such as being, substance, cause, and identity.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Key Questions in Metaphysics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ontology:</strong> What is the nature of "being"? What does it mean "to be"?</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmology:</strong> What is the origin and nature of the universe?</li>
            <li><strong>The Problem of Universals:</strong> Do abstract concepts (like "redness" or "justice") exist, or only particular things?</li>
            <li><strong>Mind-Body Problem:</strong> What is the relationship between the mind (conscious) and the body (physical)?</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom vs. Determinism:</strong> Do we have free will, or are our actions predetermined?</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Identity:</strong> What makes you "you" over time?</li>
            <li><strong>Existence of God:</strong> Does God exist? What is his nature?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A physicist can tell you *how* a ball falls (gravity). A metaphysician asks *what* gravity "is," what a "cause" is, and whether "space" and "time" are real things or just relations between objects.</p>

        <h2 id="topic3">Epistemology</h2>
        <p><strong>Epistemology</strong> is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. It seeks to answer the question, "How do we know what we know?"</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_3">It comes from the Greek words <em>epistēmē</em> ("knowledge") and <em>logos</em> ("study of").</span> It investigates the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key Questions in Epistemology:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is knowledge?</strong> Is it just "justified true belief"? (The Gettier problem challenges this).</li>
            <li><strong>Sources of Knowledge:</strong> Where does knowledge come from?
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationalism:</strong> From reason and innate ideas (covered in Unit 3).</li>
                    <li><strong>Empiricism:</strong> From sense experience (covered in Unit 3).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Problem of Skepticism:</strong> Can we be certain of anything? How can we know we are not dreaming or being deceived?</li>
            <li><strong>What is truth?</strong> Is it correspondence to reality? Is it coherence with other beliefs? Is it pragmatic usefulness?</li>
            <li><strong>Justification:</strong> What makes a belief justified? Does it need to be based on other beliefs (Foundationalism vs. Coherentism)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A historian knows that a battle happened. An epistemologist asks, "What is the *basis* for that knowledge? Is it the testimony of sources? Can that testimony be trusted? What does it *mean* to 'know' a historical fact?"</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic4">Axiology</h2>
        <p><strong>Axiology</strong> is the branch of philosophy that studies value. It seeks to answer the question, "What is valuable?"</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_4">It comes from the Greek word <em>axia</em> ("value" or "worth").</span> It is the "value theory" and is most often divided into two main sub-fields: Ethics and Aesthetics.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>1. Ethics (Moral Philosophy)</h3>
        <p>Ethics is the study of moral value. It investigates concepts of "right" and "wrong," "good" and "bad."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Questions:</strong> What is the good life? What makes an action morally right? Do we follow rules (Deontology), consequences (Consequentialism), or develop character (Virtue Ethics)?</li>
            <li><strong>Meta-Ethics:</strong> Asks questions *about* ethics itself, e.g., "Are moral truths objective or subjective?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>Aesthetics is the study of artistic value and beauty.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Questions:</strong> What is art? What is beauty? Is beauty objective (in the object) or subjective ("in the eye of the beholder")? What is the purpose of art?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A politician argues a law is "good." An axiologist (specifically, an ethicist) would ask, "What do you *mean* by 'good'? Good for whom? Based on what principle—utility, rights, or justice?"</m_span></p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A very common question is to explain the three main branches of philosophy. Remember this simple trick:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metaphysics</strong> = Study of <strong>Reality</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Epistemology</strong> = Study of <strong>Knowledge</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Axiology</strong> = Study of <strong>Value</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic5">Concept of Applied Philosophy</h2>
        <p><strong>Applied Philosophy</strong> is the branch of philosophy that applies philosophical methods, theories, and concepts to concrete, real-world problems and practical issues. It takes the abstract ideas from Metaphysics, Epistemology, and especially Axiology (Ethics) and brings them "down to earth."</p>

        <p>This is a more modern field that gained traction in the latter half of the 20th century. It moves philosophy out of the "ivory tower" and into public life, professions, and policy debates.</p>

        <h3>Major Fields of Applied Philosophy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Applied Ethics (the largest field):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bioethics:</strong> e.g., euthanasia, abortion, genetic engineering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Ethics:</strong> e.g., animal rights, climate change, resource conservation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Ethics:</strong> e.g., corporate social responsibility, fair wages, advertising.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Ethics:</strong> e.g., patient autonomy, confidentiality, end-of-life care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computer/AI Ethics:</strong> e.g., data privacy, artificial intelligence, algorithmic bias.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy of Law:</strong> Investigates the nature of law, justice, and legal reasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy of Education:</strong> Asks about the aims, methods, and purpose of education.</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy of Technology:</strong> Examines the impact of technology on human life and society.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>An <strong>Ethicist</strong> (Axiology) might develop a theory called "Utilitarianism" (the greatest good for the greatest number).</li>
            <li>An <strong>Applied Ethicist</strong> will use Utilitarianism to argue for or against a specific government policy, like whether to build a dam that will displace 1,000 people but provide electricity to 1 million.</li>
        </ul>
