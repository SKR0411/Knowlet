        <h1>Unit 4: Realism and Idealism</h1>
        <p>This unit covers the major metaphysical debate about the nature of reality: Does reality exist independent of our minds (Realism), or is it fundamentally mental or conceptual (Idealism)?</p>

        <h2 id="topic1">Realism</h2>
        <p><strong>Realism</strong> is the metaphysical view that <span id="spap_14">the external world exists <strong>independently</strong> of our minds, perceptions, and thoughts.</span> The objects in the world (trees, tables, atoms) are "real" and would continue to exist even if no one was there to perceive them.</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">Naive Realism</h3>
        <p>This is the "common sense" view of the world.
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_15"><strong>Naive Realism</strong> holds that we perceive the world <strong>directly</strong> as it <strong>actually is</strong>.</span> The properties we perceive (like color, shape, and smell) are all real properties of the external objects.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> When you see a red, ripe apple, you are directly perceiving the apple itself, and its redness and ripeness are real properties *of* the apple.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem (The Argument from Illusion):</strong> This view breaks down quickly. If you put a straight stick in water, it *looks* bent. A Naive Realist would have to say it *is* bent. But it's not. This shows a gap between "appearance" and "reality."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_2">Representationalism (Representative Realism)</h3>
        <p>This view, held by <strong>John Locke</strong>, is a more scientific version of realism that tries to solve the problem of illusion.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_16"><strong>Representationalism</strong> holds that we do <strong>not</strong> perceive the external world directly.</span> Instead, our minds directly perceive "ideas" or "representations" (sense-data), which are *caused by* and *represent* the real, external objects.
        </blockquote>
        
        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder: Representationalism]</strong>
            <p>Real Object (Apple) → causes → Sense Data (Idea of Apple) → is perceived by → Mind. (The mind never "jumps" over the sense data to see the real object).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This is where Locke's distinction (from Unit 3) becomes crucial:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Qualities:</strong> Qualities that *truly* exist in the object, like shape, size, and motion. Our ideas of these *resemble* the object.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Qualities:</strong> Qualities that are just "powers" in the object to produce sensations *in us*, like color, taste, and sound. Our ideas of these do *not* resemble the object. (The apple is not "red"; it has particles that *cause* us to see "red").</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If we only ever perceive the "representations," how can we be sure they accurately represent the "real" object? How do we know there is an external world at all?</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_3">Neo-Realism</h3>
        <p>Neo-Realism (early 20th century) was a reaction *against* Idealism. Thinkers like G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell wanted to return to a more direct realism, but in a sophisticated way.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_17"><strong>Neo-Realism</strong> accepts that the external world exists independently (like all realism), but it argues that we *can* and *do* perceive it <strong>directly</strong>.</span> When we perceive, the "content" of our perception *is* the object itself.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>It rejects the "copy" theory of Representationalism.</li>
            <li>It argues that the act of knowing (consciousness) is separate from the object known. Knowing does not change the object.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> This view struggles to explain errors, illusions, and hallucinations. If we perceive objects "directly," what are we perceiving when we see a "bent" stick or a hallucination?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_4">Critical Realism</h3>
        <p>Critical Realism (also 20th century) tried to find a "middle path" between Representationalism and Neo-Realism.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_18"><strong>Critical Realism</strong> agrees with Representationalism that there is a "medium" in perception, but it is not just a "copy."</span> It argues that the mind is *active* in grasping the world, but it still grasps a real, independent world.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>It holds that the world is "stratified": there is the <strong>empirical</strong> (what we experience), the <strong>actual</strong> (the events that happen), and the <strong>real</strong> (the underlying structures and mechanisms, like gravity, that *cause* the events).</li>
            <li>Science, for a critical realist, is the job of discovering these "real" underlying mechanisms.</li>
            <li>This view is more complex, but it allows for error (our "construction" can be wrong) while maintaining a belief in a real, structured, independent world.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic2">Idealism</h2>
        <p><strong>Idealism</strong> is the metaphysical view that <span id="spap_19">reality is fundamentally <strong>mental</strong>, mind-dependent, or spiritual.</span> It is the direct opposite of Realism (and especially Materialism). Idealists argue that "ideas," "thought," "mind," or "spirit" are the primary reality, and the "physical world" is either a product of mind or an illusion.</p>

        <h3 id="topic2_1">Subjective Idealism of Berkeley</h3>
        <p><strong>Bishop George Berkeley</strong> took John Locke's empiricism and turned it into a radical idealism. He saw a major flaw in Locke's system:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Berkeley's Argument:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Locke said all ideas come from experience.</li>
            <li>Locke also said "secondary qualities" (color, taste) are just ideas in the mind, not in the object.</li>
            <li>Berkeley asked: How do we know "primary qualities" (shape, size)? We only know them *through* our senses (and thus, our ideas). We never perceive "size" without also perceiving a "color" or "texture."</li>
            <li>Therefore, primary qualities are *also* just ideas in the mind.</li>
            <li>If *all* qualities are just ideas in the mind, then the "material substance" (matter) that Locke *assumed* was "out there" supporting these qualities is a useless, unprovable, and non-existent concept.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <blockquote>
            This leads to Berkeley's famous motto: <strong>"Esse est percipi" — "To be is to be perceived."</strong>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>For Berkeley, <span id="spap_20">a thing (like an apple) is nothing more than a <strong>collection of ideas</strong> (red, sweet, round)</span>. It does not exist independently. If no mind is perceiving it, it does not exist.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common Question:</strong> "So, does the tree in the quad cease to exist when no one is looking at it?"
        <br>
        <strong>Berkeley's Answer:</strong> No, because it is *always* being perceived by the ultimate, infinite mind: <strong>God</strong>. God is the "perceiver" who holds all of reality in existence by continuously "thinking" or "perceiving" it. The "laws of nature" are just the regular, orderly way God presents these ideas to our minds.</p>
        
        <p>This is called <strong>Subjective Idealism</strong> because reality is dependent on a *subject* (a mind, whether ours or God's).</p>

        <h3 id="topic2_2">Objective Idealism of Hegel</h3>
        <p><strong>G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831)</strong> is the most famous German Idealist. His system is incredibly complex, but the core idea is different from Berkeley's.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_21">For Hegel, reality is not dependent on *my* mind or *your* mind. Reality is the expression of one single, all-encompassing, rational structure, which he calls <strong>"The Absolute"</strong> or <strong>"Absolute Spirit" (Geist)</strong>.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li>This "Absolute Spirit" is not a "person" (like Berkeley's God) but the *entire rational process* of reality itself.</li>
            <li>The physical world, human history, art, religion, and philosophy are all different stages in the "self-realization" of this Absolute Spirit.</li>
            <li>History is the process of the Absolute becoming conscious of itself, through humanity.</li>
            <li>This is called <strong>Objective Idealism</strong> because the "ideas" or "rational structures" that make up reality are *objective*—they exist *before* and *independently* of any individual human mind, but they are still fundamentally *rational* and *conceptual* in nature.</li>
        </ul>
