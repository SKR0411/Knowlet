        <h2 id="topic1">Theories of Knowledge: Introduction</h2>
        <p>This unit deals with Epistemology, the theory of knowledge. The central debate in "modern" philosophy (17th-18th centuries) was between Rationalism and Empiricism. They are competing answers to the question: "What is the primary source of human knowledge?"</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Rationalism</h2>
        <p><strong>Rationalism</strong> is the epistemological view that <span id="spap_9"><strong>reason</strong> is the chief source and test of knowledge.</span> Rationalists believe that, in addition to sense experience, we possess "innate ideas" or *a priori* (non-experiential) knowledge. True knowledge is certain, and this certainty can only come from mathematical or logical deduction, not from the unreliable senses.</p>

        <h3>Key Proponents:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>René Descartes (1596-1650):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Method of Doubt:</strong> He doubted everything he could (senses, dreams, even math) to find an indubitable foundation for knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Cogito, Ergo Sum":</strong> ("I think, therefore I am.") The one thing he could not doubt was his own existence as a "thinking thing."</li>
                    <li><strong>Innate Ideas:</strong> From this single certainty, he used reason to "prove" the existence of God (whom he argued is perfect and not a deceiver) and the external world. The idea of God, infinity, and perfection are innate (in-born).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677):</strong> Built a complete metaphysical system based on logical-geometric deduction, starting from a few self-evident axioms (like in Euclid's geometry).</li>
            <li><strong>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716):</strong> Argued for the "Principle of Sufficient Reason" (nothing is without a reason) and a pre-established harmony between "monads" (simple substances).</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Motto:</strong> "The senses can be deceptive. True knowledge comes from pure reason, like in mathematics." (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4 is true without needing to check it in the world).
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">Empiricism</h2>
        <p><strong>Empiricism</strong> is the epistemological view that <span id="spap_10"><strong>sense experience</strong> is the primary, or even the *only*, source of knowledge.</span> Empiricists reject the concept of "innate ideas." They argue the mind at birth is a <em>tabula rasa</em> (a "blank slate").</p>

        <h3>Key Proponents:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>John Locke (1632-1704):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tabula Rasa:</strong> The mind is a blank slate, and all ideas come from experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two Sources of Ideas:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Sensation:</strong> Ideas from external objects (e.g., "yellow," "hot").</li>
                            <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Ideas from our own mind's operations (e.g., "thinking," "doubting").</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Primary vs. Secondary Qualities:</strong> Primary qualities (size, shape) exist *in* the object. Secondary qualities (color, taste) are powers in the object to produce sensations *in us*.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>George Berkeley (1685-1753):</strong> A more radical empiricist. He rejected Locke's "matter" and primary qualities, arguing that *all* qualities are mind-dependent. (Covered in Unit 4).</li>
            <li><strong>David Hume (1711-1776):</strong> The most radical empiricist. He argued that if all knowledge comes from experience, we cannot have knowledge of "causality" or "substance," as we never *experience* them directly. (Covered in Unit 5).</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Motto:</strong> "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses." (Nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu).

        <h2 id="topic4">Kant's Critical Theory</h2>
        <p><strong>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</strong> was awakened from his "dogmatic slumber" by reading Hume. He saw that both Rationalism and Empiricism had failed.
        <ul>
            <li>Rationalism led to "dogmatism" (making claims about God and the soul without any proof).</li>
            <li>Empiricism led to "skepticism" (Hume's conclusion that we can't know causality or the self).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Kant's <strong>Critical Theory</strong> (or "Transcendental Idealism") is a grand <strong>synthesis</strong> of both traditions.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_11">"Thoughts without content are empty; intuitions [sense experiences] without concepts are blind."</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This means: <strong>You need BOTH experience and reason.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>He agrees with Empiricists:</strong> All knowledge *begins* with experience. The senses provide the raw "content" or "data."</li>
            <li><strong>He agrees with Rationalists:</strong> Experience *alone* is not enough. The *mind* must actively "structure" or "organize" this raw data using its own in-built "categories."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Kant's "Copernican Revolution"</h4>
        <p>Instead of assuming the mind conforms to objects, Kant proposed that <span id="spap_12"><strong>objects must conform to our mind.</strong></span></p>
        <p>Our mind is not a passive "blank slate." It is an active "organizer" that imposes its own "rules" or "structures" onto the raw data of experience. These structures are universal and necessary for all humans.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Structures of the Mind:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forms of Intuition:</strong> The mind automatically filters all experience through <strong>Space</strong> and <strong>Time</strong>. Space and Time are not "out there"; they are the "goggles" we wear that we can never take off.</li>
            <li><strong>Categories of the Understanding:</strong> The mind then "sorts" this data into concepts like <strong>Causality</strong>, <strong>Substance</strong>, Unity, Plurality, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>How does this save knowledge from Hume's skepticism?</strong>
        Hume said we can't know causality because we don't *experience* it. Kant replies: "Of course we don't experience it! Causality is not *in* the world; it is a 'category' the *mind* *imposes* on the world to make sense of it." We are hard-wired to see the world in terms of cause and effect.</p>
        
        <h4>Phenomena vs. Noumena</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phenomena:</strong> The world as it *appears* to us, after being filtered by our mind's categories (Space, Time, Causality). This is the world of science and experience. We *can* have certain knowledge of this world.</li>
            <li><strong>Noumena (Ding an sich):</strong> The world as it *is in itself*, independent of our mind. We can *never* know this. God, soul, and freedom are "noumenal" and thus cannot be proven or disproven by science; they are matters of faith.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic5">Intuitionism</h2>
        <p><strong>Intuitionism</strong> is an epistemological view that (unlike Rationalism, Empiricism, and Kant) claims that some truths are known directly and immediately through <strong>intuition</strong>.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_13"><strong>Intuition</strong> is a form of direct, immediate, and non-inferential knowledge.</span> It is not a "hunch," but a special kind of intellectual or emotional "seeing."
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It does not rely on logical deduction (like Rationalism).</li>
            <li>It does not rely on sensory data (like Empiricism).</li>
            <li>It is a direct "grasping" of a truth or reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Proponents:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>René Descartes:</strong> His "Cogito, Ergo Sum" is arguably a truth of intuition. He *immediately* grasped his own existence as a thinking being, without a formal logical argument.</li>
            <li><strong>Henri Bergson (1859-1941):</strong> He is the most famous intuitionist. He contrasted:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intellect:</strong> Which is good for science, for analyzing the world by "freezing" it and breaking it into static parts. It is good for dealing with matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intuition:</strong> Which is the only way to grasp true reality, which he called <em>durée</em> ("duration" or "real time"). This is life, consciousness, and motion—a continuous, dynamic flow. We can only "enter into" this flow through a direct, sympathetic intuition, not by analyzing it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In Ethics:</strong> Some ethical intuitionists (like G.E. Moore) argue that we "intuit" basic moral truths (e.g., that "pleasure is good") directly, without proof.</li>
        </ul>
