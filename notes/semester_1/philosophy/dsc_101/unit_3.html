        <p>Buddhism is a Nāstika (heterodox) school founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha). It provides a "Middle Path" (Madhyamā Pratipad) which avoids the extremes of both self-indulgence (like Cārvāka) and severe asceticism. The core of Buddhist philosophy is interconnected and can be understood through its foundational doctrines.</p>

        <h2 id="topic1">Buddhism: Four Noble Truths (Cattāri Āriya Saccāni)</h2>
        <p>The Four Noble Truths are the very foundation of Buddhism, delivered by the Buddha in his first sermon. They are presented as a medical diagnosis: identifying the illness, its cause, the cure, and the prescription.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha):</strong>
                <blockquote>
                    <span id="spap_10">"There is suffering."</span> All life is inherently characterized by <em>Dukkha</em>. This includes obvious suffering like birth, sickness, old age, and death, but also subtle forms like "not getting what one wants," "being separated from what one loves," and the general, pervasive dissatisfaction of a life lived in ignorance.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Dukkha-Samudāya):</strong>
                <blockquote>
                    <span id="spap_11">"Suffering has a cause."</span> The cause of suffering is <strong>Tṛṣṇā</strong> (Pali: Taṇhā), which means "thirst," "craving," "desire," or "attachment." We suffer because we crave pleasure, existence, and non-existence. This craving, rooted in ignorance (Avidyā), binds us to the cycle of rebirth (Saṃsāra).
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Dukkha-Nirodha):</strong>
                <blockquote>
                    <span id="spap_12">"Suffering can cease."</span> The complete cessation of suffering is possible. This state of cessation is called <strong>Nirvāṇa</strong> (Pali: Nibbāna), which is the "blowing out" of the flames of craving, hatred, and delusion. It is the ultimate goal—liberation from Saṃsāra.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Dukkha-Nirodha-Gāminī-Paṭipadā):</strong>
                <blockquote>
                    <span id="spap_13">"There is a path to the cessation of suffering."</span> This path is the <strong>Noble Eightfold Path (Āryāṣṭāṅgamārga)</strong>.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">The Noble Eightfold Path</h3>
        <p>This is the practical prescription for ending Dukkha. The eight factors are grouped into three categories:</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Pratītyasamutpāda (Dependent Origination)</h2>
        <p><strong>Pratītyasamutpāda</strong> (Pali: Paṭiccasamuppāda) is the Buddha's explanation of *how* the second Noble Truth (the cause of suffering) works. It is the core metaphysical doctrine of Buddhism.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_14"><strong>Pratītyasamutpāda</strong>, or "Dependent Origination," is the doctrine that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena.</span> In short: "This being, that becomes; from the arising of this, that arises. This not being, that does not become; from the cessation of this, that ceases."
        </blockquote>

        <p>This doctrine explains the "Middle Path" in metaphysics:
        <ul>
            <li>It avoids <strong>Eternalism</strong> (the belief in a permanent, unchanging substance, like Atman or God). Nothing exists independently.</li>
            <li>It avoids <strong>Nihilism</strong> (the belief that nothing exists or that everything is random). Things are not random; they are part of a web of cause and effect.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is most famously applied in the "Twelve Links" (Dvādaśa Nidānas) that explain the cycle of rebirth and suffering (Saṃsāra):</p>
        
        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder]</strong>
            <p>A circular diagram showing the 12 links: (1) Ignorance → (2) Formations (Karma) → (3) Consciousness → (4) Name-and-Form → (5) Six Senses → (6) Contact → (7) Feeling → (8) Craving (Tṛṣṇā) → (9) Clinging → (10) Becoming → (11) Birth → (12) Old Age and Death → (and back to 1. Ignorance).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The whole chain shows how craving (Tṛṣṇā) leads to suffering, and the whole chain is rooted in Ignorance (Avidyā). The path to liberation is to break this chain, which is done by destroying the first link (Ignorance) with Wisdom (Prajñā).</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Pratītyasamutpāda is the *key* to all other Buddhist doctrines.
            <ul>
                <li>It explains <strong>Dukkha</strong> (by showing how suffering arises from craving and ignorance).</li>
                <li>It implies <strong>Nairātmyavāda (No-Self)</strong> (because the "self" is just a dependent-arising bundle of processes).</li>
                <li>It implies <strong>Kṣaṇikavāda (Momentariness)</strong> (because everything is in a constant state of arising and ceasing).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3">Nairātmyavāda (Doctrine of No-Self / Anātman)</h2>
        <p>This is perhaps the most distinctive and challenging doctrine of Buddhism. It is a direct rejection of the Upaniṣadic concept of a permanent, eternal Ātman.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_15"><strong>Nairātmyavāda</strong> (Sanskrit) or <strong>Anattā</strong> (Pali) is the doctrine of "No-Self" or "No-Soul."</span> It states that there is no permanent, unchanging, independent entity called a "self" or "soul" underlying our existence.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>So, what is the "person"? The Buddha analyzed the individual into <strong>Five Aggregates (Pañca-Skandhas)</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Form (Rūpa):</strong> The physical body and material elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Feelings (Vedanā):</strong> Sensations (pleasant, painful, or neutral).</li>
            <li><strong>Perceptions (Saṃjñā):</strong> Recognition, cognition, and labeling.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Formations (Saṃskāra):</strong> Karmic impulses, volitions, habits, and dispositions.</li>
            <li><strong>Consciousness (Vijñāna):</strong> The "awareness" or "knowing" faculty.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The "self" or "I" is simply a conventional name (like "chariot") given to this temporary, constantly changing, dependently-arisen collection of the Five Aggregates. The problem (Dukkha) arises when we *cling* to this impermanent bundle, believing it to be a permanent "me."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common Question:</strong> If there is no self (Anātman), who gets reborn? Who gets liberated?
        <br><strong>Answer:</strong> Buddhism does not teach *no* self, but *no permanent* self. What continues is not a "soul" but the *karmic process*. It's like lighting one candle from another. The flame (karmic energy, consciousness) is "transferred," but the flame on the new candle is neither the same as, nor entirely different from, the old one. It is a new link in the causal chain of Pratītyasamutpāda.</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">Kṣaṇikavāda (Doctrine of Momentariness)</h2>
        <p>This doctrine is a logical extension of Pratītyasamutpāda and Nairātmyavāda. It is also known as the doctrine of Impermanence (Anitya).</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_16"><strong>Kṣaṇikavāda</strong> (or Kṣaṇabhangavāda) is the doctrine of "momentariness."</span> It states that all phenomena (including the Five Aggregates) are radically impermanent (Anitya), arising and passing away in every moment (kṣaṇa).
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Nothing is static. Everything is in a state of constant flux. A river you see now is not the "same" river one moment later, as new water has flowed in. Likewise, the "you" who started reading this sentence is not the "same" you who is finishing it—your thoughts, feelings, and even physical cells have changed.</p>
        <p>The "persistence" or "identity" we perceive in objects (like a table) and ourselves is an illusion. We are not a "being," but a "becoming"—a continuous, dynamic process, a "stream of consciousness."</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>The Three Marks of Existence:</strong> These three doctrines form the "Three Marks of Existence" (Trilakṣaṇa) in Buddhism:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Anitya (Impermanence)</strong> — which is Kṣaṇikavāda.</li>
                <li><strong>Dukkha (Suffering)</strong> — which is the First Noble Truth.</li>
                <li><strong>Anātman (No-Self)</strong> — which is Nairātmyavāda.</li>
            </ol>
            These three are interconnected: Because all things are <strong>impermanent</strong> (Anitya), clinging to them as if they were permanent leads to <strong>suffering</strong> (Dukkha). The "thing" we cling to most is our "self," but this too is impermanent, and the wisdom to see this is the insight into <strong>No-Self</strong> (Anātman).
