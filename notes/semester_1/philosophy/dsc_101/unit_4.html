        <h1>Unit 4: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika</h1>
        <p>The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools are two of the six Āstika (orthodox) systems. They developed separately but were later merged into a "sister" school (Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika) due to their shared realistic worldview.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nyāya</strong> is the school of logic and epistemology (how we know).</li>
            <li><strong>Vaiśeṣika</strong> is the school of metaphysics and atomism (what we know).</li>
        </ul>
        Nyāya provides the logical method, and Vaiśeṣika provides the content (the categories of reality) to be analyzed.</p>

        <h2 id="topic1">Nyāya: Theory of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Nyāya is also called <em>Tarka-śāstra</em> (the science of reasoning). Its primary goal is to attain liberation (Moksha) by dispelling ignorance, which is achieved through <strong>correct knowledge</strong> (Pramā). Therefore, its main focus is on epistemology (Pramāṇa-śāstra).</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">Pramā and Apramā (Valid and Invalid Knowledge)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Pramā (प्रमा):</strong></span> Valid knowledge. It is defined as a true and non-contradictory cognition of an object as it really is (<em>yathārtha-anubhava</em>). For example, seeing a rope as a "rope."</li>
            <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Apramā (अप्रमा):</strong></span> Invalid knowledge. This is knowledge that does not correspond to reality. It includes:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Smṛti (Memory):</strong> Nyāya does not consider memory to be valid knowledge (Pramā) because it is not a *present* cognition; it is a *recollection* of a previous Pramā.</li>
                    <li><strong>Saṃśaya (Doubt):</strong> The state of uncertainty, e.g., "Is that a post or a man?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Viparyaya (Error):</strong> False cognition, e.g., mistaking a rope for a snake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tarka (Hypothetical Reasoning):</strong> Not considered valid knowledge itself, but a *tool* to arrive at it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_2">Pramāṇa (Sources of Valid Knowledge)</h3>
        <p>A <strong>Pramāṇa</strong> is the valid means or source of acquiring Pramā (valid knowledge). The Nyāya school accepts <strong>four</strong> independent Pramāṇas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pratyakṣa</strong> (Perception)</li>
            <li><strong>Anumāna</strong> (Inference)</li>
            <li><strong>Upamāna</strong> (Comparison)</li>
            <li><strong>Śabda</strong> (Testimony)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(Note: Your syllabus only explicitly lists Pratyakṣa and Anumāna, so we will focus on them.)</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_3">Pratyakṣa (Perception)</h3>
        <p>This is the most fundamental Pramāṇa. It is the direct cognition or knowledge that arises from the contact between a sense organ (<em>indriya</em>) and its object (<em>artha</em>).</p>
        <p>Nyāya classifies perception in several ways:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Laukika (Ordinary) vs. Alaukika (Extraordinary)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laukika (Ordinary):</strong> When there is direct contact between sense organs and worldly objects.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>External:</strong> Through the five external senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch).</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal:</strong> Through the mind (<em>Manas</em>), which perceives internal states like pleasure, pain, desire, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alaukika (Extraordinary):</strong> When there is no direct sensory contact, but perception still occurs. This is unique to Nyāya.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sāmānyalakṣaṇa:</strong> Perception of a "universal" (e.g., when I see *one* cow, I perceive "cowness" in all cows).</li>
                    <li><strong>Jñānalakṣaṇa:</strong> "Complicated perception" where one sense "sees" the quality of another (e.g., "The ice *looks* cold." The "coldness" is a quality of touch, not sight, but they are associated through past knowledge).</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogaja:</strong> The intuitive perception of enlightened Yogis, who can see past, present, and future.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Nirvikalpaka (Indeterminate) vs. Savikalpaka (Determinate)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nirvikalpaka (Indeterminate):</strong> The first, brief moment of perception. It is a simple, undifferentiated awareness of an object, *before* any analysis or naming. E.g., seeing a "something" without yet knowing "it is a book."</li>
            <li><strong>Savikalpaka (Determinate):</strong> The second stage, which is a conceptualized, judgmental cognition. E.g., "That is a blue book." This is the knowledge we use in daily life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_4">Anumāna (Inference) and its kinds</h3>
        <p><strong>Anumāna</strong> is the knowledge that *follows* (anu) some other knowledge (māna). It is knowing something (the unperceived) by means of something else (the perceived).</p>
        <p>The logical basis of inference is the <span id="spap_19"><strong>Vyāpti</strong></span>: the universal, invariable, and unconditional relationship between the <em>Hetu</em> (middle term/reason) and the <em>Sādhya</em> (major term/object of inference).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Example of Inference:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>The hill has fire (<strong>Sādhya</strong> - what we are proving).</li>
                <li>Because it has smoke (<strong>Hetu</strong> - the reason/mark).</li>
                <li>Wherever there is smoke, there is fire (<strong>Vyāpti</strong> - the universal rule).</li>
                <li>The hill has smoke (<strong>Pakṣadharmatā</strong> - the presence of the Hetu in the <em>Pakṣa</em>, or subject).</li>
                <li>Therefore, the hill has fire.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Kinds of Anumāna</h4>
        <p>Nyāya classifies inference in three main ways:</p>

                    <td>An internal, psychological process of reasoning. A person sees smoke and *concludes for themselves* that there is fire. No formal steps are needed.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Parārtha</strong> (For others)</td>
                    <td>A formal, syllogistic argument used to *convince* another person. This requires the famous <strong>five-step syllogism</strong> (Pañcāvayava).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td rowspan="3"><strong>2. Based on the nature of Vyāpti</strong></td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Śeṣavat</strong></td>
                    <td>Inferring an unperceived *cause* from a perceived *effect*. (e.g., "Seeing a flooded river [effect], I infer it must have rained upstream [cause].")</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Sāmānyatodṛṣṭa</strong></td>
                    <td>Inference based not on direct causal link, but on a general principle or analogy. (e.g., "We infer the movement of the sun by seeing its position change in the sky, just as we infer our own movement.")</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        </div>
        <p><em>(Note: Your syllabus does not list Upamāna and Śabda, but they are the other two Nyāya pramāṇas. Upamāna is "comparison" - knowing "gavai" from "like a cow". Śabda is "testimony" - knowledge from a trustworthy source, like the Vedas.)</em></p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Vaiśeṣika: Theory of Reality</h2>
        <p>The Vaiśeṣika school is concerned with metaphysics. It provides a realistic, pluralistic, and atomistic view of the universe. Its goal is to classify all of reality into its fundamental components, known as <strong>Padārthas</strong> (categories).</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_1">The Seven Padārthas (Categories)</h3>
        <p>A <span id="spap_20"><strong>Padārtha</strong></span> is "an object which can be named" or "a category of reality." According to Vaiśeṣika, everything in the universe can be classified into one of seven categories. Understanding these leads to liberation.</p>
        <p>The first six are (Bhāva - positive reality):</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Dravya</strong> (Substance)</li>
            <li><strong>Guṇa</strong> (Quality)</li>
            <li><strong>Karma</strong> (Action)</li>
            <li><strong>Sāmānya</strong> (Generality / Universal)</li>
            <li><strong>Viśeṣa</strong> (Particularity)</li>
            <li><strong>Samavāya</strong> (Inherence)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The seventh category was added later (Abhāva - negative reality):</p>
        <ol start="7">
            <li><strong>Abhāva</strong> (Non-existence)</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A common question is to list and briefly describe the seven Padārthas. The syllabus focuses on the last four, which are the more abstract ones.
        </div>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_2">Padārthas: Sāmānya, Viśeṣa, Samavāya, and Abhāva</h3>
        
        <h4>Sāmānya (Generality / Universal)</h4>
        <p>Sāmānya is the "universal" or "class-essence" that is present in multiple individuals. It is the reason we group different things under one name.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Many individual cows exist (Cow 1, Cow 2, Cow 3). The *common property* that makes them all "cows" is the universal of "cowness" (<em>gotva</em>).</li>
            <li>It is one (eka) but resides in many (aneka).</li>
            <li>It is eternal (nitya), while the individual cows are non-eternal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Viśeṣa (Particularity)</h4>
        <p>This is the unique doctrine that gives the Vaiśeṣika school its name. Viśeṣa is the "particularity" or "individuality" that makes one thing *different* from all other things.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application:</strong> This is especially needed to distinguish between two eternal, non-perceivable substances. For example, how is one indivisible atom (paramāṇu) of "earth" different from *another* indivisible atom of "earth"? By its Viśeṣa.</li>
            <li>It is the unique identifier for each eternal substance (atoms, souls, space, time, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Samavāya (Inherence)</h4>
        <p>Samavāya is the relation of "inherence." It is a permanent, intimate, and inseparable connection between two things that cannot exist independently.</p>
        <p>It is different from <strong>Saṃyoga</strong> (conjunction), which is a temporary connection (like a book on a table - they can be separated).</p>
        <p>Samavāya holds between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The part and the whole:</strong> Threads and the cloth.</li>
            <li><strong>The quality and the substance:</strong> "Blueness" and a "blue pot."</li>
            <li><strong>The action and the substance:</strong> "Moving" and the "moving car."</li>
            <li><strong>The universal and the individual:</strong> "Cowness" and the "cow."</li>
            <li><strong>The particularity and the eternal substance:</strong> Viśeṣa and the atom.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_21">Samavāya is the "glue" of Vaiśeṣika metaphysics.</span> It explains how a substance can *have* qualities, actions, and a universal, while remaining a unified whole.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Abhāva (Non-existence)</h4>
        <p>This is the seventh category, which deals with "absence" or "negation." Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika realists argue that "non-existence" is just as real as "existence." When I say "there is no jar on the table," this is a valid piece of knowledge, so the "absence of the jar" must be a real category.</p>
        <p>There are two main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saṃsargā-bhāva (Relational Absence):</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prāg-abhāva (Prior Non-existence):</strong> The absence of an object *before* it is created. (e.g., The non-existence of the pot in the clay before the potter makes it.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pradhvaṃsā-bhāva (Posterior Non-existence):</strong> The absence of an object *after* it is destroyed. (e.g., The non-existence of the pot after it is smashed.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Atyantā-bhāva (Absolute Non-existence):</strong> Absence in all times and places. (e.g., "A square circle," "horns on a rabbit.")</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Anyonyā-bhāva (Mutual Non-existence):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The absence of one thing as another. This is the basis of identity and difference. (e.g., "A pot is *not* a cloth." This is the mutual absence of pot-ness in cloth and cloth-ness in pot.)</li>

        <h3 id="topic2_3">Paramāṇuvāda (Atomism)</h3>
        <p>This is the Vaiśeṣika metaphysical theory of the physical world. It is an "atomistic pluralism."</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_22"><strong>Paramāṇuvāda</strong> is the doctrine that all non-eternal, physical objects (like pots, tables, bodies) are composed of indivisible, partless, and eternal atoms (<strong>Paramāṇu</strong>).</span>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What are atoms?</strong> They are the smallest, indivisible particles of the four material substances: <strong>Earth, Water, Fire, and Air</strong>. (Note: Akāśa/Ether is not atomic; it is one, eternal, and all-pervading).</li>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> All atoms of the *same* substance (e.g., all water atoms) are identical, but they differ from atoms of other substances.</li>
            <li><strong>Creation:</strong> When two atoms (paramāṇu) combine, they form a <strong>Dvyaṇuka</strong> (dyad). Three dyads combine to form a <strong>Tryaṇuka</strong> (triad). Triads are the first *perceivable* particles (like a speck of dust in a sunbeam). All larger objects are built up from these.</li>
            <li><strong>Destruction (Pralaya):</strong> Destruction is the process of breaking these objects back down into their constituent dyads and atoms. The atoms themselves are *never* destroyed; they are eternal.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of God (Īśvara):</strong> The atoms are the material cause of the world. But what starts the process of creation and destruction? Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika posits God as the "efficient cause" who combines the atoms at the beginning of creation and separates them at dissolution, guided by the unseen karmic merits (Adṛṣṭa) of all the individual souls.</li>
