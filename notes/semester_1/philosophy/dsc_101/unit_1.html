        <h2 id="topic1">General ideas about the Schools of Indian Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The term 'Indian Philosophy' refers to the philosophical traditions that originated in the Indian subcontinent. In Sanskrit, the term for philosophy is <span id="spap_1"><strong>Darśana</strong></span>, which literally means "vision" or "seeing." It implies a direct perception of truth, not just intellectual speculation. These schools are all fundamentally concerned with the nature of reality, the self, and the path to liberation (Moksha).</p>
        <p>Indian Philosophy is traditionally classified into two broad categories: <strong>Āstika</strong> (Orthodox) and <strong>Nāstika</strong> (Heterodox).</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Key Distinction:</strong> The primary criterion for this division is <em>not</em> belief in God. Instead, it is the acceptance (Āstika) or rejection (Nāstika) of the authority of the Vedas as a source of knowledge.
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">Āstika (Orthodox) Schools</h3>
        <p>These schools accept the authority of the Vedas. There are six major systems (known as <strong>Ṣaḍdarśana</strong>), which are often grouped into three pairs based on their metaphysical and logical similarities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Nyāya:</strong> The school of logic and epistemology. It focuses on the conditions of correct knowledge and the means of acquiring it.</li>
            <li><strong>Vaiśeṣika:</strong> The school of atomistic pluralism. It explains the world through a set of categories (Padārthas) and argues that all physical objects are composed of indivisible atoms (Paramānu).</li>
            <li><strong>Sāṃkhya:</strong> A strongly dualistic school that posits two ultimate realities: <strong>Puruṣa</strong> (consciousness, the self) and <strong>Prakṛti</strong> (matter, nature).</li>
            <li><strong>Yoga:</strong> The practical application of Sāṃkhya philosophy. It accepts Sāṃkhya's metaphysics but adds the concept of God (Īśvara) and provides a practical, meditative path to achieve liberation (Kaivalya).</li>
            <li><strong>Mīmāṃsā (or Pūrva Mīmāṃsā):</strong> This school focuses on the exegesis of the ritualistic portions of the Vedas (the Brāhmaṇas). It emphasizes the performance of duty (Dharma) as prescribed in the Vedas.</li>
            <li><strong>Vedānta (or Uttara Mīmāṃsā):</strong> This school focuses on the philosophical (speculative) portions of the Vedas (the Upaniṣads). It explores the nature of Brahman (Ultimate Reality) and Ātman (the Self). It has several sub-schools, including Advaita (non-dualism), Viśiṣṭādvaita (qualified non-dualism), and Dvaita (dualism).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="topic1_2">Nāstika (Heterodox) Schools</h3>
        <p>These schools reject the authority of the Vedas. The three main Nāstika schools are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cārvāka (or Lokāyata):</strong> A thoroughly materialistic and skeptical school. It rejects the soul, rebirth, and any reality beyond what can be perceived by the senses.</li>
            <li><strong>Buddhism:</strong> Founded by Gautama Buddha, this school rejects a permanent self (Anātman) and the authority of the Vedas. It offers a "Middle Path" to achieve Nirvāṇa (liberation from suffering).</li>
            <li><strong>Jainism:</strong> Based on the teachings of the Tīrthaṅkaras (like Mahāvīra), this school emphasizes non-violence (Ahiṃsā), non-absolutism (Anekāntavāda), and non-attachment (Aparigraha).</li>
        </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A very common exam question is to differentiate between Āstika and Nāstika schools. Remember the deciding factor is the <strong>acceptance or rejection of Vedic authority</strong>, not belief in God. For example, Sāṃkhya is an Āstika school but is traditionally atheistic, while Nyāya is Āstika and theistic.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic2">Concept of Rta (ऋत)</h2>
        <p>The concept of <strong>Rta</strong> is one of the most fundamental concepts in the Vedas, particularly the Rigveda. It is the principle of cosmic, natural, and moral order.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_2"><strong>Rta (ऋत)</strong> is the principle of natural, moral, and sacrificial order in the universe.</span> It is the "cosmic law" that governs everything, from the movement of stars and the changing of seasons to the actions of humans and the efficacy of rituals.
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cosmic Order:</strong> Rta is the law that makes the sun rise, the moon wax and wane, and the seasons change. It is the physical order of the universe.</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Order:</strong> In the human sphere, Rta is the "right path" or moral law. Living in accordance with Rta is living righteously. Its opposite, <em>Anṛta</em>, means "disorder," "falsehood," and "sin."</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual Order:</strong> Rta also governs the correct performance of sacrifices (Yajña). The rituals were seen as a way to align human life with the cosmic order, and only when performed correctly (according to Rta) would they be effective.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Evolution of the Concept:</strong> In later Indian thought, the concept of Rta becomes less prominent and is gradually absorbed into and replaced by the concepts of <strong>Dharma</strong> (moral and social duty) and <strong>Karma</strong> (the law of cause and effect).</p>

        <h2 id="topic3">Law of Karma (कर्म)</h2>
        <p>The Law of Karma is the universal law of moral cause and effect. It is a cornerstone of almost all Indian philosophical schools (except Cārvāka).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_3">The <strong>Law of Karma (कर्म)</strong> states that every action (Karma) produces a corresponding result or consequence (Phala), which the actor must experience.</span> Good actions (Punya) lead to pleasure and a favorable rebirth, while bad actions (Pāpa) lead to pain and an unfavorable rebirth.
        </blockquote>

        <p>This law operates automatically, like a natural law, without the need for a divine judge (though some schools, like Nyāya, posit God as the "distributor" of karmic fruits).</p>

        <h3 id="topic3_1">Types of Karma</h3>
        <p>To explain why people suffer or enjoy life without any apparent immediate cause, the theory of Karma is linked to the concept of rebirth (Saṃsāra) and a "storehouse" of karmic potencies. Karma is generally classified into three types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sañcita Karma (Accumulated):</strong> This is the vast "storehouse" of all karmic actions (both good and bad) from all past lives, which have not yet borne fruit.</li>
            <li><strong>Prārabdha Karma (Fructifying):</strong> This is the portion of Sañcita Karma that is "ripe" and has been allotted to be experienced in the <em>current</em> life. This karma determines one's birth, lifespan, and key life experiences (both pleasant and painful). It cannot be avoided.</li>
            <li><strong>Kriyamāṇa Karma (Being-made) / Āgāmī Karma (Future):</strong> This is the karma that we are creating in the present moment through our current actions and choices. This karma will be added to the Sañcita store and will bear fruit in the future (either later in this life or in a future life).</li>
        </ol>

        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder]</strong>
            <p>A diagram showing Kriyamāṇa Karma being added to the Sañcita "storehouse," and a portion of Sañcita becoming Prārabdha Karma for the current life, which in turn leads to rebirth (Saṃsāra).</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="topic3_2">Karma, Rebirth (Saṃsāra), and Liberation (Moksha)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saṃsāra (Rebirth):</strong> Karma is the engine that drives the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (Saṃsāra). The unresolved karmic balance compels the soul to take on a new body to experience its consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Moksha (Liberation):</strong> The ultimate goal of all Indian philosophies (except Cārvāka) is <strong>Moksha</strong> (or Nirvāṇa). Moksha is the complete liberation <em>from</em> the cycle of Saṃsāra. This is achieved by exhausting all karma and/or neutralizing its binding power through spiritual knowledge (Jñāna), devotion (Bhakti), or disinterested action (Karma-Yoga).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not confuse Karma with "fate" or "predestination." While Prārabdha Karma (past actions) determines the conditions of your *present* life, you have free will (Kriyamāṇa Karma) to act in the *present*, which shapes your *future*. The theory emphasizes both causal determinism (from the past) and free will (in the present).
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic4">Upanisadic concept of Self/Atman</h2>
        <p>The Upaniṣads, which form the concluding part of the Vedas, are also known as <strong>Vedānta</strong> ("the end of the Vedas"). They shift the focus from Vedic rituals to philosophical inquiry into the ultimate nature of reality.</p>
        <p>The two most important concepts in the Upaniṣads are <strong>Brahman</strong> and <strong>Ātman</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span id="spap_4"><strong>Brahman (ब्रह्मन्):</strong></span> The Ultimate, Absolute Reality. It is the uncaused cause of the universe, the "ground of all being." It is described as eternal, infinite, unchanging, and the source and substance of everything.</li>
            <li><span id="spap_5"><strong>Ātman (आत्मन्):</strong></span> The individual self or soul. It is the innermost, true essence of a person, beyond the body, mind, and ego.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic4_1">The Great Sayings (Mahāvākyas)</h3>
        <p>The central, revolutionary insight of the Upaniṣads is the identity of the individual self (Ātman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman). This is expressed in several "Great Sayings" (Mahāvākyas):</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Tat Tvam Asi — "That Thou Art" (That You Are)</strong>
            <p>This is the most famous Mahāvākya (from the Chāndogya Upaniṣad). It is the instruction from the teacher (Uddālaka) to his student (Śvetaketu), meaning: "The Ultimate Reality (Tat/Brahman) is the very same as your own inner self (Tvam/Ātman)."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Other Mahāvākyas include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aham Brahmāsmi:</strong> "I am Brahman" (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad)</li>
            <li><strong>Ayam Ātmā Brahma:</strong> "This Self (Ātman) is Brahman" (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad)</li>
            <li><strong>Prajñānam Brahma:</strong> "Consciousness is Brahman" (Aitareya Upaniṣad)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic4_2">Characteristics of Atman</h3>
        <p>The Upaniṣads describe the Ātman as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eternal (Nitya):</strong> It is not born, and it does not die. The body dies, but the Ātman continues.</li>
            <li><strong>Unchanging (Avikārī):</strong> It is the silent, unaffected witness (Sākṣī) of all the changes in the body and mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Pure Consciousness (Cit):</strong> Its essential nature is consciousness. It is the "light" that illuminates the mind, senses, and world.</li>
            <li><strong>Beyond the Ego:</strong> The Ātman is *not* the 'I' that we normally identify with (our personality, thoughts, or feelings). This small 'I' is the ego (Ahaṃkāra), which is a product of ignorance (Avidyā).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The true nature of the Ātman is often described as <strong>Sat-Cit-Ānanda</strong> (Being-Consciousness-Bliss). Realizing this true self (Ātma-jñāna) is the key to liberation (Moksha) from the cycle of Karma and Saṃsāra.</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be prepared to explain the identity of Ātman and Brahman. This is the central doctrine of the Upaniṣads and the foundation for the later Advaita Vedānta school. The realization that "my" innermost self is the "same" as the ultimate reality of the entire cosmos is the core philosophical insight.
