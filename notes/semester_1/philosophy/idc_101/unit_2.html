        <h2 id="topic1">The Principle of "Sanctity of Life"</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_6">The <strong>Sanctity of Life</strong> doctrine is the belief that human life is sacred, intrinsically valuable, and inviolable.</span> This means that life has value in and of itself, not just because it is useful or brings pleasure.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This principle is the foundation for the ethical debates in this unit. It has two main sources:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Religious:</strong> In traditions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, life is seen as a sacred gift from God. Only God has the authority to give life and take it away. To intentionally end a human life (one's own or another's) is to "play God" and is considered a grave sin.</li>
            <li><strong>Secular:</strong> Even without a religious basis, the principle can be grounded in the concept of <strong>human dignity</strong> or the inherent worth of a rational being. Philosophers like Immanuel Kant argued that rational beings are "ends in themselves" and must never be treated as a "mere means."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The topics of suicide, abortion, and euthanasia are all flashpoints because they represent direct challenges to this principle, often placing it in conflict with other important values like <strong>Autonomy</strong> and <strong>Quality of Life</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic2">Suicide</h2>
        <p><strong>Suicide</strong> is the act of intentionally and voluntarily ending one's own life. This topic pits the "Sanctity of Life" (the value of life itself) against the "Right to Autonomy" (the right to self-determination).</p>

        <h3 id="topic2_1">Ethical Arguments Against Suicide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Religious Argument:</strong> As above, it violates God's sovereignty over life. It is seen as a rejection of God's gift.</li>
            <li><strong>Kantian (Deontological) Argument:</strong> Immanuel Kant argued that we have a "perfect duty" to ourselves not to commit suicide. To do so is to treat our own humanity as a "mere means" to the end of escaping pain, which violates the Categorical Imperative.</li>
            <li><strong>Social/Communitarian Argument:</strong> We do not live in isolation. We have duties and responsibilities to our family, friends, and society. Suicide is seen as a selfish act that abandons these duties and causes great harm to the community left behind.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Law Argument:</strong> (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) All beings have a natural instinct for self-preservation. Suicide is "unnatural" as it directly violates this fundamental natural law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic2_2">Ethical Arguments for (or permitting) Suicide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Autonomy Argument:</strong> (e.g., John Stuart Mill) A person is sovereign over their own body and mind. If a person, in a rational state, decides that their life is no longer worth living, they have the right to end it. This is the ultimate expression of self-determination.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilitarian Argument:</strong> While often complex, a utilitarian might argue that if a person's future contains far more suffering than happiness, and their death would not cause more net harm to others, then suicide *could* be a rational choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality of Life Argument:</strong> This argument rejects the "Sanctity of Life" in favor of "Quality of Life." It's not *mere biological life* that is valuable, but a *life with a certain quality* (e.g., consciousness, dignity, freedom from pain). If this quality is irretrievably lost, then ending the life is not an ethical tragedy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Abortion</h2>
        <p><strong>Abortion</strong> is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks.</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic3_1">The Central Conflict: Fetus vs. Woman</h3>
        <p>The abortion debate is a direct conflict between two sets of claims:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Moral Status of the Fetus:</strong> Is the fetus a "person" with a right to life? If so, when does it become one? At conception? At viability? At birth?</li>
            <li><strong>The Rights of the Pregnant Woman:</strong> What is the extent of a woman's right to <strong>autonomy</strong> and <strong>bodily integrity</strong>? Does she have the right to decide what happens in and to her own body?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="topic3_2">The Pro-Life (Conservative) Position</h3>
        <p>This position gives priority to the fetus.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Claim:</strong> The fetus is a human being (a "person") from the moment of conception.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument:</strong>
                1. The fetus is an innocent human being.
                2. It is always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent human being.
                3. Therefore, abortion is always (or almost always) wrong.</li>
            <li>This view is a direct application of the <strong>Sanctity of Life</strong> principle to the fetus. The fetus's "right to life" outweighs the woman's "right to choose."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="topic3_3">The Pro-Choice (Liberal) Position</h3>
        <p>This position gives priority to the pregnant woman.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Claim:</strong> The fetus is *not* a person (at least not in the early stages). The pregnant woman's right to bodily autonomy is the primary consideration.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument (Mary Anne Warren):</strong> To be a "person" with a "right to life," one needs certain characteristics like consciousness, reason, self-awareness, and communication. A fetus has none of these, so it is not a person.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument (Judith Jarvis Thomson):</strong> Even *if* we grant the fetus is a person (for the sake of argument), it does *not* have the right to use another person's body against their will.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Famous Analogy:</strong> You wake up to find a famous violinist, who will die without you, has been plugged into your kidneys against your will. You must stay plugged in for 9 months. Thomson argues you have no *moral obligation* to do so; you have the right to unplug yourself, even if it means the violinist dies. She argues pregnancy (especially from rape) is analogous.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="topic3_4">The Moderate Position</h3>
        <p>This position tries to find a middle ground.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Claim:</strong> The fetus is not a person at conception, but it develops moral status *over time*.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument:</strong> An early-stage embryo has little moral status, but a late-stage fetus (e.g., one that is "viable" - can survive outside the womb) is very "person-like" and has a strong claim to life.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Abortion may be ethically permissible in the first trimester, but becomes progressively harder to justify and should be impermissible after viability (except to save the mother's life).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)</h2>
        <p>This is the legal and medical term for abortion. This part of the syllabus moves from pure theory to the practical application of law and policy.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_7"><strong>Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)</strong> refers to the legal framework that governs *how* and *when* an abortion can be performed.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This shifts the debate from "Is abortion moral?" to "Under what conditions should abortion be *legal*?"</One of the most important real-world examples is India's <strong>Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Key features of such laws (e.g., the MTP Act) provide a practical, moderate ethical solution. They typically allow termination under specific conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To save the life of the woman.</strong> (Almost universally accepted).</li>
            <li><strong>To protect the woman's physical or mental health.</strong> (A broad category).</li>
            <li><strong>In cases of pregnancy caused by rape or incest.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>If there is a substantial risk of fetal abnormalities</strong> (e.g., the child would be born with severe physical or mental disabilities).</li>
            <li><strong>Due to contraceptive failure</strong> (in some legal systems).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These laws also set "gestational limits," (e.g., up to 20 or 24 weeks), which reflects the "moderate" ethical view that the moral status of the fetus increases over time.</p>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be ready to contrast the three topics.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Suicide:</strong> Ending *one's own* life. Pits <strong>Sanctity of Life vs. Autonomy</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Abortion:</strong> Ending a *fetus's* life. Pits <strong>Sanctity of Fetal Life vs. Woman's Autonomy</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Euthanasia (Unit 3):</strong> Ending *another's* life (with their consent or in their best interest). Pits <strong>Sanctity of Life vs. Quality of Life & Autonomy</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            Note the common conflict: <strong>Sanctity of Life vs. Autonomy</strong>.
