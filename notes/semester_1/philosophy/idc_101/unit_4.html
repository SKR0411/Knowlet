        <p><strong>Professional Ethics</strong> is a branch of applied ethics that establishes the moral codes and standards of conduct for individuals in a specific profession (e.g., medicine, law, journalism, business).</p>

        <h2 id="topic1">Human Rights</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_11"><strong>Human Rights</strong> are universal, inalienable, and fundamental rights that all human beings possess simply by virtue of being human.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Universal:</strong> They apply to everyone, everywhere, regardless of race, gender, religion, or nationality.</li>
            <li><strong>Inalienable:</strong> They cannot be taken away or given up.</li>
            <li><strong>Fundamental:</strong> They are the basic rights necessary for a life of human dignity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>They are famously enumerated in the <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</strong> adopted by the UN in 1948. They form a "global ethical standard" against which the actions of governments and individuals can be judged.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Types of Human Rights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First-Generation (Civil-Political) Rights:</strong> "Negative rights" that protect from state interference.
                <br><em>(Examples: Right to life, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, right to a fair trial).</em></li>
            <li><strong>Second-Generation (Socio-Economic) Rights:</strong> "Positive rights" that require the state to provide certain goods.
                <br><em>(Examples: Right to education, right to work, right to healthcare).</em></li>
            <li><strong>Third-Generation (Collective) Rights:</strong> Rights that belong to groups or peoples.
                <br><em>(Examples: Right to self-determination, right to a healthy environment).</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The concept of Human Rights is the ethical foundation for legal and professional ethics, setting a baseline for how all people must be treated.</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Punishment and its Theories</h2>
        <p>This is a core topic in legal ethics. When the state punishes a criminal, what is the *ethical justification* for inflicting that harm (e.G., imprisonment, fines)? There are three main theories.</p>

        <h3 id="topic2_1">Deterrence Theory</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Punishment is justified because it <strong>prevents future crime</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Basis:</strong> Consequentialist / Utilitarian. The "good consequence" (a safer society) outweighs the "harm" of the punishment.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Forms:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Specific Deterrence:</strong> Aims to deter the *individual criminal* from re-offending. (e.g., "The prison sentence was so unpleasant, I'll never do that again.")</li>
                    <li><strong>General Deterrence:</strong> Aims to deter *other people* (the general public) by making an example of the criminal. (e.g., "I saw they got 10 years for that; I'm not going to risk it.")</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Critique:</strong> Can justify punishing an innocent person (if it deters others). Can also justify disproportionately severe punishments (if it creates a strong deterrent).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_2">Retributive Theory</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Punishment is justified because the criminal <strong>deserves it</strong>. It is "paying back" a debt to society.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Phrase:</strong> <em>"Lex Talionis"</em> or "An eye for an eye."</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Basis:</strong> Deontological / Kantian. It is a "backward-looking" theory that focuses on justice and moral desert, not future consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Argument:</strong> A criminal has freely and rationally chosen to break the social contract and harm another. Justice *demands* that they suffer a proportionate penalty. To not punish them is to disrespect them as a rational agent.</li>
            <li><strong>Critique:</strong> Can be seen as primitive or "vengeful." Offers no hope for rehabilitation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_3">Reformative / Rehabilitative Theory</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The purpose of punishment is to <strong>reform or "heal" the criminal</strong> and reintegrate them into society.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Basis:</strong> Humanitarian / Consequentialist. Views crime as a "disease" or a product of poor social conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Punishment should be tailored to the criminal, not the crime. It should include education, therapy, and job training.</li>
            <li><strong>Critique:</strong> Can be impractical (some criminals may be beyond reform). It can be unjust (a minor crime might require a "long" sentence for rehabilitation, while a major crime by a "healthy" person might require none).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Medical Ethics</h2>
        <p>Medical ethics involves the moral principles that guide doctors and other healthcare professionals in their practice. As seen in Units 2 & 3, this field deals with life-and-death issues.</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic3_1">The Four Principles</h3>
        <p>Modern medical ethics is dominated by the "Four Principles" approach, popularized by Beauchamp and Childress:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span id="spap_12"><strong>Autonomy (Respect for the Patient):</strong></span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient has the right to self-determination. They have the right to make informed decisions about their own body, including the right to *refuse* treatment.</li>
                    <li>This is the basis for <strong>Informed Consent</strong>: a doctor must explain the risks, benefits, and alternatives of a procedure before the patient can validly consent to it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span id="spap_13"><strong>Beneficence (Do Good):</strong></span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The doctor has a positive duty to act in the best interests of the patient and to promote their well-being.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span id="spap_14"><strong>Non-maleficence (Do No Harm):</strong></span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The doctor has a duty to avoid causing unnecessary pain or suffering. This is the core of the Hippocratic Oath: "First, do no harm."</li>
                    <li>This principle is often in conflict with beneficence (e.g., chemotherapy causes great harm [nausea, hair loss] but is done for a greater good [curing cancer]).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span id="spap_15"><strong>Justice (Be Fair):</strong></span>
                <ul>
                    <li>This principle concerns the *distribution* of scarce healthcare resources (e.g., hospital beds, organ transplants, vaccines).</li>
                    <li>It demands that patients in similar situations are treated fairly and that there is no discrimination based on race, wealth, or other factors.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic4">Media Ethics</h2>
        <p>Media ethics applies to journalists, publishers, and broadcasters. It tries to balance the *power* of the media with its *responsibility*.</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic4_1">Key Issues in Media Ethics</h3>
        <p>The central conflict is often between <strong>The Public's Right to Know</strong> and other values.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Truth and Accuracy:</strong> The primary duty of a journalist is to report the facts accurately and avoid distortion. This includes a duty to correct errors promptly (accountability).</li>
            <li><strong>Independence and Objectivity:</strong> Journalists should avoid conflicts of interest (e.g., accepting gifts, "checkbook journalism"). They should strive for balanced, neutral reporting rather than promoting a personal or corporate agenda.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy vs. The Public's Right to Know:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the public *need* to know about a politician's private life? Or do they just *want* to know?</li>
                    <li>Media ethics requires balancing the public's legitimate interest against the harm caused by intrusion.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Harm Limitation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Journalists should be compassionate. Should they publish the name of a sexual assault victim? Should they show graphic images of a tragedy?</li>
                    <li>This principle suggests "minimizing harm" and treating subjects with dignity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
