        <h3 id="topic1_1">What is Ethics? The Three Main Branches</h3>
        <p>Before understanding Applied Ethics, it's helpful to see where it fits. Ethics, or Moral Philosophy, is broadly divided into three main areas:</p>
        
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Branch</th>
                    <th>Guiding Question</th>
                    <th>Explanation</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>1. Meta-Ethics</strong></td>
                    <td>"What *is* goodness?"</td>
                    <td>This is the most abstract branch. It doesn't ask what is right or wrong, but asks about the *nature* of morality itself. (e.g., Are moral truths objective? What do the words "good" and "bad" mean?)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>2. Normative Ethics</strong></td>
                    <td>"What *should* I do?"</td>
                    <td>This branch creates general theories and principles to guide moral action. (e.g., <strong>Utilitarianism:</strong> "Do whatever creates the most happiness." <strong>Deontology:</strong> "Follow your moral duties.")</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>3. Applied Ethics</strong></td>
                    <td>"How do I apply ethics to *this* situation?"</td>
                    <td>This is the most practical branch. It takes the theories from Normative Ethics and applies them to specific, concrete, and often controversial real-world problems.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder]</strong>
            <p>A funnel or pyramid diagram showing Meta-Ethics at the top (most abstract), Normative Ethics in the middle (theories), and Applied Ethics at the bottom (concrete problems).</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3 id="topic1_2">Defining Applied Ethics</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_1"><strong>Applied Ethics</strong> is the branch of philosophy that attempts to apply general ethical theories to specific moral problems, issues, and fields of human activity.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The goal is not just to talk *about* problems, but to find a path *through* them. It's the "boots on the ground" part of moral philosophy. It moves ethics from the textbook into the hospital, the courtroom, the boardroom, and the newsroom.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example of the process:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> A patient with a terminal illness is in great pain and asks a doctor to help them die. (This is the topic of Euthanasia, Unit 3).</li>
            <li><strong>The Applied Ethicist's Job:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analyze the problem:</strong> What are the facts? What are the patient's wishes? What are the doctor's obligations?</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply Normative Theories:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <strong>Deontologist</strong> might ask: "Is there a universal duty to preserve life? Would this be using the doctor as a 'mere means' to death?"</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Utilitarian</strong> might ask: "Which action will produce the greatest good? Does the patient's suffering outweigh any potential future happiness? What about the family's suffering?"</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Virtue Ethicist</strong> might ask: "What would a compassionate and virtuous doctor do in this situation?"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Propose a Solution:</strong> Based on this analysis, the ethicist would argue for or against a specific course of action (e.g., "Passive euthanasia is permissible, but active euthanasia is not").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic2">Different Branches of Applied Ethics</h2>
        <p>Applied Ethics is a vast field. This paper's syllabus covers several key branches. Other major branches also exist.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="spap_2"><strong>Medical Ethics / Bioethics:</strong></span> (Covered in Units 2, 3, 4)
                <p>This is one of the largest and most established branches. It deals with the moral challenges arising from medicine, healthcare, and biological sciences.
                <br><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Euthanasia, abortion, patient confidentiality, informed consent, genetic engineering, cloning, resource allocation (who gets the organ transplant?).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="spap_3"><strong>Professional Ethics:</strong></span> (Covered in Unit 4)
                <p>This branch formulates moral standards and codes of conduct for professionals. It recognizes that professionals (like doctors, lawyers, or journalists) have special duties and powers, and thus special ethical obligations.
                <br><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Confidentiality, conflicts of interest, honesty, integrity, and public responsibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="spap_4"><strong>Media Ethics:</strong></span> (Covered in Unit 4)
                <p>A specific subset of professional ethics, this deals with the moral obligations of journalists, news organizations, and other media platforms.
                <br><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Truthfulness in reporting, bias, privacy of public figures, use of graphic images, "fake news," and the public's right to know.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="spap_5"><strong>Corporate Ethics / Business Ethics:</strong></span> (Covered in Unit 5)
                <p>This branch examines the ethical principles and moral problems that arise in a business environment.
                <br><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Corporate social responsibility (CSR), fair wages, safe working conditions, honest advertising, environmental impact of businesses, insider trading.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Ethics:</strong>
                <p>A subset of professional ethics for lawyers and judges.
                <br><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Attorney-client privilege, when a lawyer must/must not defend a client they know is guilty, conflicts of interest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Environmental Ethics:</strong>
                <p>This branch examines the moral relationship between human beings and the natural world.
                <br><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Animal rights, climate change, pollution, sustainability, obligations to future generations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> For an "Introduction" question, be prepared to clearly define the three branches of ethics (Meta, Normative, Applied) and show how Applied Ethics is different. Use a specific example (like abortion or euthanasia) to show *how* a normative theory (like utilitarianism) is "applied" to a real-world problem.
