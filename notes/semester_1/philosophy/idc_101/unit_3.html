        <h2 id="topic1">Euthanasia: Introduction</h2>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">Defining Euthanasia</h3>
        <p>The word <strong>Euthanasia</strong> comes from the Greek: <span id="spap_8"><em>"eu"</em> (good) and <em>"thanatos"</em> (death)</span>. It literally means "good death."</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_9"><strong>Euthanasia</strong>, or "mercy killing," is the act of intentionally ending a person's life to relieve them of incurable disease or unbearable suffering.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It is crucial to distinguish Euthanasia from Suicide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Suicide:</strong> A person ends their *own* life.</li>
            <li><strong>Euthanasia:</strong> A *second party* (usually a doctor) performs the action that ends the person's life.</li>
            <li><strong>Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS):</strong> A related concept where a doctor *provides the means* (e.g., a prescription for a lethal dose), but the patient *takes the final action themselves*.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_2">Sanctity of Life vs. Quality of Life</h3>
        <p>This unit's debate centers on the conflict between two principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sanctity of Life:</strong> The idea that *all* human life is sacred and has intrinsic value, regardless of its condition. (See Unit 2).</li>
            <li><strong>Quality of Life:</strong> The idea that the *value* of life depends on its quality. A life of unbearable, irremediable pain, or a life without consciousness (e.g., a persistent vegetative state), may be considered not worth living.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Proponents of euthanasia argue that <strong>Autonomy</strong> (the right to choose one's own death) and <strong>Quality of Life</strong> can outweigh the <strong>Sanctity of Life</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic2">Types of Euthanasia</h2>
        <p>Euthanasia is classified using two different criteria, which can be combined.</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_1">Classification by Patient's Consent</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Voluntary Euthanasia:</strong> The patient is mentally competent, understands their situation, and explicitly and repeatedly requests to die. This is based on the principle of autonomy.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Voluntary Euthanasia:</strong> The patient is *incompetent* (e.g., in a coma, a newborn with a severe defect, severe dementia) and cannot make a decision. The decision is made by a proxy (like a family member or doctor) based on the patient's "best interests" or a living will.</li>
            <li><strong>Involuntary Euthanasia:</strong> The patient is competent but does *not* want to die, and is killed anyway. This is universally condemned as murder.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_2">Classification by Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Active Euthanasia:</strong> Involves a direct *action* to end the patient's life. This is an act of "killing."
                <br><em>(Example: A doctor administering a lethal injection.)</em></li>
            <li><strong>Passive Euthanasia:</strong> Involves *withholding or withdrawing* life-sustaining treatment, allowing the patient to die from their underlying condition. This is an act of "letting die."
                <br><em>(Example: A doctor turning off a ventilator or not starting a course of antibiotics for a new infection.)</em></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_3">The Four Main Categories</h3>
        <p>By combining these, we get four main categories in the debate:</p>
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Active (Killing)</th>
                    <th>Passive (Letting Die)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Voluntary</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Active Voluntary Euthanasia</strong><br>(Patient asks for a lethal injection)</td>
                    <td><strong>Passive Voluntary Euthanasia</strong><br>(Patient asks to have their ventilator removed)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Non-Voluntary</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Active Non-Voluntary Euthanasia</strong><br>(Giving a lethal injection to a patient in a coma)</td>
                    <td><strong>Passive Non-Voluntary Euthanasia</strong><br>(Removing a feeding tube from a patient in a coma)</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table></div>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Distinction: Active vs. Passive</strong>
            <p>Many legal systems and medical codes (like the Hippocratic Oath) make a sharp distinction here.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passive Euthanasia</strong> is often considered ethically (and legally) permissible, as it is seen as allowing nature to take its course and respecting a patient's right to refuse treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Euthanasia</strong> is much more controversial (and illegal in most places), as it is seen as a direct act of killing, which violates the doctor's duty to "do no harm."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, some philosophers (like James Rachels) argue there is <strong>no moral difference</strong> between actively killing and passively letting die. If the *intent* (to end suffering) and the *outcome* (death) are the same, the method is irrelevant. Rachels even argues that active euthanasia may be *more* humane, as it is quicker and less painful than a slow death by dehydration (passive).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3">Conditions of Euthanasia (The Ethical Debate)</h2>
        <p>This refers to the arguments for and against euthanasia, which also outline the "conditions" under which it might be permitted.</p>

        <h3 id="topic3_1">Arguments FOR Euthanasia</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Argument from Autonomy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the strongest argument for <strong>voluntary</strong> euthanasia.</li>
                    <li>It states that all competent individuals have a right to self-determination, which includes making decisions about their own life and death.</li>
                    <li>Forcing someone to live on in unbearable pain against their will is a violation of their personal freedom.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Argument from Beneficence (or Compassion):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the core "mercy" argument.</li>
                    <li>The fundamental duty of a doctor is to act in the patient's best interest, which includes relieving suffering (beneficence) and preventing harm (non-maleficence).</li>
                    <li>In cases of <em>incurable</em> disease and <em>unbearable</em> suffering, where death is imminent, the most compassionate act (the "greatest good") may be to provide a quick, painless death.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="topic3_2">Arguments AGAINST Euthanasia</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The "Sanctity of Life" Argument:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>As discussed in Unit 2, this religious or secular principle holds that all innocent human life is intrinsically valuable and must not be intentionally terminated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Role of the Doctor (Hippocratic Oath):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The traditional role of the doctor is to heal and preserve life, summed up by the principle "First, do no harm."</li>
                    <li>Active euthanasia is seen as a direct violation of this medical code, undermining the trust between doctors and patients.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Possibility of Error or Cure:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A patient may be misdiagnosed, or their condition may not be as "incurable" as believed.</li>
                    <li>A new cure or palliative treatment (pain relief) might be discovered. Euthanasia is irreversible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 id="topic3_3">The "Slippery Slope" Argument</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_10">This is the most famous argument against euthanasia. It is a <strong>consequentialist</strong> argument that warns against legalizing *any* form of euthanasia.</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The argument goes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If we legalize "safe" cases of euthanasia (like active voluntary), we create a precedent.</li>
            <li>This will lead to a "slippery slope" where the practice expands to less-safe cases.</li>
            <li>Voluntary → Non-voluntary (e.g., "The patient would have wanted this").</li>
            <li>Terminally ill → Chronically ill → Mentally ill.</li>
            <li>Patients who are a "burden" on their families or the state may be pressured,
            explicitly or implicitly, to "choose" death.</li>
            <li>This would lead to a society where the vulnerable (the old, the disabled, the poor) are at risk.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Conditions to Prevent the Slope:</strong> Proponents of euthanasia argue that this slope can be prevented by establishing strict legal <strong>conditions</strong> or safeguards, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The patient must have an incurable, terminal illness.</li>
            <li>The patient must be in unbearable, irremediable suffering.</li>
            <li>The patient must make a voluntary, repeated, and well-documented request.</li>
            <li>The patient must be mentally competent.</li>
            <li>A second, independent doctor must confirm the diagnosis and prognosis.</li>
        </ul>
