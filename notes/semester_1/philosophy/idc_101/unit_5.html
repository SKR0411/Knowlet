        <h3 id="topic1_1">What is Business Ethics?</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_16"><strong>Business Ethics</strong> (or Corporate Ethics) is a form of applied ethics that examines the ethical principles and moral problems that arise in a business environment.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It questions the "profit-motive" and asks what, if any, moral obligations a corporation has. It applies to all aspects of business conduct, from the boardroom to the factory floor, and deals with the relationships between a business and its stakeholders.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Issues in Business Ethics:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Fair wages and safe working conditions.</li>
            <li>Honest advertising (truth vs. "puffery").</li>
            <li>Environmental responsibility and pollution.</li>
            <li>Product safety and liability.</li>
            <li>Whistleblowing (when an employee exposes unethical practices).</li>
            <li>Discrimination and affirmative action in hiring.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="topic1_2" class="exam-tip">Stockholder Theory vs. Stakeholder Theory</h3>
        <p>This is the central debate in business ethics. Who does a company (and its CEO) work for?</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR)</h2>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_1">What is CSR?</h3>
        <p>CSR is the practical application of the Stakeholder Theory.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_17"><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</strong> is a business model where a company holds itself accountable for its impact on society, including social, economic, and environmental factors.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>It is the idea that a corporation is a "corporate citizen" with a duty to contribute to societal goals and make a positive impact, beyond just making money. This is now a legal requirement in many countries (e.g., India's Companies Act, 2013, mandates CSR for large companies).</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_2">The Pyramid of CSR</h3>
        <p>A popular model by Archie Carroll organizes a company's responsibilities into four levels, from most basic to most advanced.</p>
        
        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder: Carroll's Pyramid of CSR]</strong>
            <p>A pyramid with 4 levels (bottom to top):
            <br><strong>1. Economic Responsibility</strong> (Base) - "Be Profitable." (This is the foundation).
            <br><strong>2. Legal Responsibility</strong> - "Obey the Law."
            <br><strong>3. Ethical Responsibility</strong> - "Be Ethical." (Do what is right and fair, even if not required by law).
            <br><strong>4. Philanthropic Responsibility</strong> (Top) - "Be a Good Corporate Citizen." (Actively contribute to the community, e.g., donations, charity work).</p>
        </div>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Economic:</strong> The primary responsibility is to be profitable and economically viable. If the company fails, all other responsibilities are moot.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal:</strong> The company must obey the laws and regulations of the society it operates in.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> The company must go *beyond* the law and do what is right, just, and fair. (e.g., paying a living wage, not just the legal minimum wage).</li>
            <li><strong>Philanthropic (or Discretionary):</strong> The highest level. This is "giving back" to the community through donations, sponsoring local events, or funding educational programs.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="topic2_3">The Triple Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>This is a modern framework for CSR that measures a company's success not just on profit, but on three "bottom lines":</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_18">The <strong>Triple Bottom Line (TBL)</strong> argues that a truly successful and sustainable company must measure its performance in three areas: <strong>People, Planet, and Profit.</strong></span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>People (Social):</strong> How socially responsible is the company? This includes fair labor practices, employee well-being, and its impact on the local community.</li>
            <li><strong>Planet (Environmental):</strong> How environmentally sustainable is the company? This includes its carbon footprint, pollution, waste management, and use of renewable resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Profit (Economic):</strong> The traditional measure of economic profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The TBL model makes CSR a core part of a business's strategy, arguing that long-term *profit* is impossible without taking care of the *people* and the *planet* that support the business.</p>
