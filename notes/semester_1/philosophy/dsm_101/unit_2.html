        <h2 id="topic1">Cārvāka (Lokāyata) School</h2>
        <p>The Cārvāka school, also known as <strong>Lokāyata</strong> ("philosophy of the people"), is the primary Nāstika (heterodox) school of Indian materialism. It is unique for its rejection of almost all core principles of other Indian philosophies, such as the soul, rebirth, karma, and liberation.</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">Cārvāka Epistemology (Theory of Knowledge)</h3>
        <p>Cārvāka epistemology is the foundation of its entire philosophy. It is radically empiricist.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_6">The Cārvāka school accepts only one valid source of knowledge (Pramāṇa): <strong>Perception (Pratyakṣa)</strong>.</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Their argument is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rejection of Inference (Anumāna):</strong> Cārvāka famously rejects inference as a valid source of knowledge. Why? Because inference relies on a universal relationship (known as <em>Vyāpti</em>), such as "wherever there is smoke, there is fire." The Cārvāka argument is that we can never be certain of this relationship. We have not seen all cases of smoke and fire in the universe, so we cannot establish this universal, unconditional link. Any inference is therefore just a guess or probability, not certainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejection of Testimony (Śabda):</strong> They also reject testimony, including the authority of the Vedas. They argue that we must first establish the reliability of the person giving the testimony, which we can only do through perception. As for the Vedas, they are seen as the compositions of clever priests, full of contradictions and falsehoods, designed to earn a living.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> While Cārvākas *reject* inference as a *pramāṇa* (a valid, certain source of new knowledge), they do use it in everyday life. Their philosophical point is that it is not 100% reliable and therefore cannot be used to "prove" the existence of non-perceivable things like God, soul, or heaven.
        </div>

        <h3 id="topic1_2">Cārvāka Metaphysics (Theory of Reality)</h3>
        <p>Flowing directly from their epistemology, Cārvāka's metaphysics is pure materialism. Their motto is: "If I cannot perceive it, it does not exist."</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rejection of Non-Material Entities:</strong> They deny the existence of God, soul (Ātman), karma, rebirth (Saṃsāra), and liberation (Moksha). These are all considered illusions or priestly inventions because they cannot be perceived.</li>
            <li><strong>Four Elements:</strong> The world is made of only four elements (<em>Mahābhūtas</em>): <strong>Earth, Water, Fire, and Air</strong>. (They reject the fifth element, Ether/Ākāśa, because it cannot be perceived).</li>
            <li><strong>Consciousness as an Epiphenomenon:</strong> This is a key part of their theory. If there is no soul, what is consciousness? The Cārvākas argue that <span id="spap_7">consciousness is an emergent property (an "epiphenomenon") that arises from a specific combination of the four material elements</span>, just as the intoxicating power of alcohol arises from the combination of yeast and molasses (which do not have this property individually).
            <blockquote>"Consciousness is produced when the elements... combine in a specific proportion. When the body is destroyed, consciousness also perishes."</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rejection of God:</strong> There is no need for a God to create the world. The world comes into being and runs through the natural, spontaneous combination (<em>Svabhāva</em>) of the elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_3">Cārvāka Ethics</h3>
        <p>Since there is no afterlife, no karma, and no soul, the Cārvāka school advocates a form of <strong>hedonism</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The only goal of human life (<em>Puruṣārtha</em>) is the pursuit of pleasure (Kāma) and wealth (Artha).</li>
            <li>They reject Dharma (moral duty) and Moksha (liberation) as valid goals.</li>
            <li>Their philosophy is famously (and perhaps unfairly) summarized in the slogan: "As long as you live, live happily. Borrow money and drink ghee. Once the body is reduced to ashes, how can it ever return?"</li>
            <li>It's important to note this is not necessarily a call for crude sensualism, but rather a "live in the moment" philosophy that values tangible, earthly happiness over unseen, promised rewards in a hypothetical afterlife.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Jainism</h2>
        <p>Jainism is a Nāstika school (it rejects the Vedas) but, unlike Cārvāka, it is deeply spiritual and ethical. It has a robust metaphysics (believing in the soul, karma, and rebirth) and a unique epistemology.</p>
        <p>The core of Jaina epistemology and metaphysics is its "pluralism." For Jainism, reality (Tattva) is complex, multifaceted, and possesses infinite aspects. No single human viewpoint can capture the <em>entire</em> truth. This leads to their two most famous doctrines.</p>

        <h3 id="topic2_1">Anekāntavāda (The Theory of Non-Absolutism)</h3>
        <p><strong>Anekānta-vāda</strong> literally means "the doctrine of the non-one-sidedness" of reality. It is the metaphysical foundation.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_8"><strong>Anekāntavāda</strong> is the metaphysical doctrine that all objects and truths are multifaceted and possess infinite, and often contradictory, aspects.</span> Reality is complex, and any single statement about it is at best a partial truth.
        </blockquote>

        <p>For example, an object is permanent in one sense (as substance) but impermanent in another (as its modes or forms change). A person is "tall" (relative to a child) and "not tall" (relative to a building). Both statements are true from different perspectives.</p>
        <p>This doctrine is a deliberate rejection of other philosophical schools that make absolute claims (e.g., Buddhism saying "everything is impermanent" or Vedānta saying "only Brahman is permanent"). Jainism holds that they are all partially correct but wrong in their absolutism.</p>

        <p><strong>The Parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant:</strong> This famous parable, popular in Jainism, perfectly illustrates Anekāntavāda. Several blind men try to describe an elephant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One touches the leg and says, "An elephant is like a pillar."</li>
            <li>One touches the tail and says, "An elephant is like a rope."</li>
            <li>One touches the trunk and says, "An elephant is like a thick snake."</li>
            <li>One touches the ear and says, "An elephant is like a large fan."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each man is correct from his limited perspective, but all are wrong in assuming their partial knowledge is the whole truth. Anekāntavāda is the ability to see that the elephant is all these things and more.</p>

        </div>

        <h3 id="topic2_2">Syādvāda (The Theory of Conditioned Predication)</h3>
        <p>If Anekāntavāda is the metaphysical theory (<em>what</em> reality is), then <strong>Syādvāda</strong> is its logical and epistemological expression (<em>how</em> we should talk about it).</p>
        <p>Since all knowledge is partial and relative to a specific standpoint, Jainism insists that all our judgments (predications) must be qualified. We should not make absolute "is" or "is not" statements. Instead, we must use the qualifier <strong>"Syāt"</strong> (which means "from a certain point of view," "relatively," or "conditionally").</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_9"><strong>Syādvāda</strong> is the logical doctrine that every statement about reality must be prefixed with "Syāt" (conditionally) to acknowledge its partial and relative nature.</span>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This leads to the <strong>Saptabhaṅgī-naya</strong>, or the "seven-fold predication," which shows how to express a judgment about an object from different viewpoints:</p>

        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Predicate (Naya)</th>

                    <td>6. Syāt-nāsti-avaktavyaṃ</td>

                    <td>Conditionally, it <strong>is not</strong> and <strong>is inexpressible</strong>. (e.g., It is not blue [in all respects], and this total nature is inexpressible).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>7. Syāt-asti-nāsti-avaktavyaṃ</td>

                    <td>Conditionally, it <strong>is</strong>, <strong>is not</strong>, and <strong>is inexpressible</strong>. (This is the most complete, albeit complex, judgment).</td>

        </table>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember the clear distinction. <strong>Anekāntavāda</strong> is the *metaphysical* theory that reality is many-sided. <strong>Syādvāda</strong> is the *logical* theory of how to express this many-sidedness in language using conditional judgments ("Syāt"). You can't have Syādvāda without Anekāntavāda.
