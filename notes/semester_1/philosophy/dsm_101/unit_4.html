        <h1>Unit 4: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika</h1>
        <p>The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools are two of the six Āstika (orthodox) systems. They developed separately but were later merged into a "sister" school (Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika) due to their shared realistic worldview.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nyāya</strong> is the school of logic and epistemology (how we know).</li>
            <li><strong>Vaiśeṣika</strong> is the school of metaphysics and atomism (what we know).</li>
        </ul>
        Nyāya provides the logical method, and Vaiśeṣika provides the content (the categories of reality) to be analyzed.</p>

        <h2 id="topic1">Nyāya: Theory of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Nyāya is also called <em>Tarka-śāstra</em> (the science of reasoning). Its primary goal is to attain liberation (Moksha) by dispelling ignorance, which is achieved through <strong>correct knowledge</strong>. Therefore, its main focus is on epistemology (Pramāṇa-śāstra).</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_1">Pramā and Pramāṇa</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span id="spap_17"><strong>Pramā (प्रमा):</strong></span> Valid knowledge. It is defined as a true and non-contradictory cognition of an object as it really is (<em>yathārtha-anubhava</em>). For example, seeing a rope as a "rope."</li>
            <li><strong>Apramā (अप्रमा):</strong> Invalid knowledge. This is knowledge that does not correspond to reality. It includes:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Smṛti (Memory):</strong> Nyāya does not consider memory to be valid knowledge (Pramā) because it is not a *present* cognition; it is a *recollection* of a previous Pramā.</li>
                    <li><strong>Saṃśaya (Doubt):</strong> The state of uncertainty, e.g., "Is that a post or a man?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Viparyaya (Error):</strong> False cognition, e.g., mistaking a rope for a snake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tarka (Hypothetical Reasoning):</strong> Not considered valid knowledge itself, but a *tool* to arrive at it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
             <li><span id="spap_18"><strong>Pramāṇa (प्रमाण):</strong></span> The valid means or source of acquiring Pramā (valid knowledge).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The object of valid knowledge is a <strong>Prameya</strong>. The person who has the knowledge is the <strong>Pramātā</strong>. The result of the process is the <strong>Pramiti</strong> (which is synonymous with Pramā).</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_2">The Four Pramāṇas</h3>
        <p>A <strong>Pramāṇa</strong> is the valid means or source of acquiring Pramā (valid knowledge). The Nyāya school accepts <strong>four</strong> independent Pramāṇas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pratyakṣa</strong> (Perception)</li>
            <li><strong>Anumāna</strong> (Inference)</li>
            <li><strong>Upamāna</strong> (Comparison)</li>
            <li><strong>Śabda</strong> (Testimony)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(Note: Your syllabus only explicitly lists Pratyakṣa and Anumāna, so we will focus on them.)</p>

        <h3 id="topic1_3">Pratyakṣa (Perception)</h3>
        <p>This is the most fundamental Pramāṇa. It is the direct cognition or knowledge that arises from the contact between a sense organ (<em>indriya</em>) and its object (<em>artha</em>).</p>
        <p>Nyāya classifies perception in several ways:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Laukika (Ordinary) vs. Alaukika (Extraordinary)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laukika (Ordinary):</strong> When there is direct contact between sense organs and worldly objects.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>External:</strong> Through the five external senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch).</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal:</strong> Through the mind (<em>Manas</em>), which perceives internal states like pleasure, pain, desire, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alaukika (Extraordinary):</strong> When there is no direct sensory contact, but perception still occurs. This is unique to Nyāya.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sāmānyalakṣaṇa:</strong> Perception of a "universal" (e.g., when I see *one* cow, I perceive "cowness" in all cows).</li>
                    <li><strong>Jñānalakṣaṇa:</strong> "Complicated perception" where one sense "sees" the quality of another (e.g., "The ice *looks* cold." The "coldness" is a quality of touch, not sight, but they are associated through past knowledge).</li>
                    <li><strong>Yogaja:</strong> The intuitive perception of enlightened Yogis, who can see past, present, and future.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Nirvikalpaka (Indeterminate) vs. Savikalpaka (Determinate)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nirvikalpaka (Indeterminate):</strong> The first, brief moment of perception. It is a simple, undifferentiated awareness of an object, *before* any analysis or naming. E.g., seeing a "something" without yet knowing "it is a book."</li>
            <li><strong>Savikalpaka (Determinate):</strong> The second stage, which is a conceptualized, judgmental cognition. E.g., "That is a blue book." This is the knowledge we use in daily life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="topic1_4">Anumāna (Inference) and its kinds</h3>
        <p><strong>Anumāna</strong> is the knowledge that *follows* (anu) some other knowledge (māna). It is knowing something (the unperceived) by means of something else (the perceived).</p>
        <p>The logical basis of inference is the <span id="spap_19"><strong>Vyāpti</strong></span>: the universal, invariable, and unconditional relationship between the <em>Hetu</em> (middle term/reason) and the <em>Sādhya</em> (major term/object of inference).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Example of Inference:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>The hill has fire (<strong>Sādhya</strong> - what we are proving).</li>
                <li>Because it has smoke (<strong>Hetu</strong> - the reason/mark).</li>
                <li>Wherever there is smoke, there is fire (<strong>Vyāpti</strong> - the universal rule).</li>
                <li>The hill has smoke (<strong>Pakṣadharmatā</strong> - the presence of the Hetu in the <em>Pakṣa</em>, or subject).</li>
                <li>Therefore, the hill has fire.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Kinds of Anumāna</h4>
        <p>Nyāya classifies inference in three main ways:</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Parārtha</strong> (For others)</td>
                    <td>A formal, syllogistic argument used to *convince* another person. This requires the famous <strong>five-step syllogism</strong> (Pañcāvayava).</td>

                    <td rowspan="3"><strong>2. Based on the nature of Vyāpti</strong></td>

                    <td><strong>Śeṣavat</strong></td>

                </tr>

                <li><strong>Hetu</strong> (Reason): "Because it has smoke."</li>
                <li><strong>Udāharaṇa</strong> (Example with Vyāpti): "Whatever has smoke has fire, e.g., a kitchen."</li>

                <li><strong>Nigamana</strong> (Conclusion): "Therefore, the hill has fire."</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic2">Vaiśeṣika: Theory of Reality</h2>
        <p>The Vaiśeṣika school is concerned with metaphysics. It provides a realistic, pluralistic, and atomistic view of the universe. Its goal is to classify all of reality into its fundamental components, known as <strong>Padārthas</strong> (categories).</p>
        
        <h3 id="topic2_1">Categories (The Seven Padārthas)</h3>
        <p>A <span id="spap_20"><strong>Padārtha</strong></span> is "an object which can be named" or "a category of reality." According to Vaiśeṣika, everything in the universe can be classified into one of seven categories. Understanding these leads to liberation.</p>
        
        <div style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #ccc; margin: 15px 0;">
            <strong>[Diagram Placeholder: The 7 Padārthas]</strong>
            <p>A chart showing Padārtha (Category) splitting into two: <strong>Bhāva</strong> (Existence) and <strong>Abhāva</strong> (Non-existence).<br>
            <strong>Bhāva</strong> further splits into six: 1. Dravya (Substance), 2. Guṇa (Quality), 3. Karma (Action), 4. Sāmānya (Generality), 5. Viśeṣa (Particularity), 6. Samavāya (Inherence).<br>
            <strong>Abhāva</strong> is the 7th category.</p>
        </div>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Dravya (Substance):</strong> The "substratum" where qualities and actions reside. There are nine substances: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether (Ākāśa), Time (Kāla), Space (Dik), Soul (Ātman), and Mind (Manas).</li>
            <li><strong>Guṇa (Quality):</strong> A property that resides in a substance but is inactive (e.g., color, taste, smell, touch).</li>
            <li><strong>Karma (Action):</strong> Motion that resides in a substance (e.g., upward, downward, contraction, expansion).</li>
            <li><strong>Sāmānya (Generality / Universal):</strong> The "class-essence" that is present in multiple individuals (e.g., "cowness" in all cows).</li>
            <li><strong>Viśeṣa (Particularity):</strong> The unique "individuality" that distinguishes one eternal substance from another (e.g., what makes one atom of earth different from another). This gives the school its name.</li>
            <li><strong>Samavāya (Inherence):</strong> The permanent, inseparable "glue" that relates a quality to its substance, or a universal to its individual (e.g., the "blueness" *inheres* in the "blue pot").</li>
            <li><strong>Abhāva (Non-existence):</strong> The seventh category (added later), which treats "absence" as a real, knowable entity (e.g., the "absence of a jar" on the table).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="topic2_2">Atomism (Paramāṇuvāda)</h3>
        <p>This is the Vaiśeṣika metaphysical theory of the physical world. It is an "atomistic pluralism."</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span id="spap_21"><strong>Paramāṇuvāda</strong> is the doctrine that all non-eternal, physical objects (like pots, tables, bodies) are composed of indivisible, partless, and eternal atoms (<strong>Paramāṇu</strong>).</span>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What are atoms?</strong> They are the smallest, indivisible particles of the four material substances: <strong>Earth, Water, Fire, and Air</strong>. (Note: Akāśa/Ether, Time, Space, Soul, and Mind are not atomic).</li>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> All atoms of the *same* substance (e.g., all water atoms) are identical, but they differ from atoms of other substances.</li>
            <li><strong>Creation (Sṛṣṭi):</strong> Creation is the process of atoms combining. God (Īśvara), guided by the unseen karmic merits (Adṛṣṭa) of all souls, causes the atoms to move.
                <ol>
                    <li>Two atoms (paramāṇu) combine → <strong>Dvyaṇuka</strong> (dyad).</li>
                    <li>Three dyads (dvyaṇuka) combine → <strong>Tryaṇuka</strong> (triad).</li>
                    <li>Triads are the first *perceivable* particles (like a speck of dust in a sunbeam). All larger objects are built up from these.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Destruction (Pralaya):</strong> Destruction is the process of breaking these objects back down into their constituent dyads and atoms. The atoms themselves are *never* destroyed; they are eternal.</li>
