        <h2>1. Meaning of Postulates</h2>
        <p>A <strong>postulate</strong> is a requirement or a necessary presupposition. In Ethics, postulates are the conditions that must be assumed to exist so that morality and moral responsibility can have any meaning. If these conditions are missing, an action cannot be judged as right or wrong.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Without these postulates, the concept of duty, responsibility, and moral judgment would collapse."
        </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section id="spap_selfConsciousness">
        <h2>2. Self-Consciousness (Personality)</h2>
        <p>Morality applies only to <strong>Persons</strong>, not to things or animals. The first postulate of morality is that the moral agent must possess <strong>Self-consciousness</strong> or Personality.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Aspects:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agency:</strong> A person must be aware of themselves as the <em>doer</em> of the action. If a person is unaware of their own existence or identity (e.g., in a state of advanced dementia or total unconsciousness), they cannot be a moral subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> The "Self" must persist through time. I am the same person today who made a promise yesterday; therefore, I am responsible for keeping it today. </li>
            <li><strong>Distinction:</strong> The agent must be able to distinguish themselves from the external world and other individuals.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="spap_mentalLife">
        <h2>3. Mental Life (Rationality)</h2>
        <p>For an action to be moral, it must be performed by an agent who possesses an "Inner" or <strong>Mental Life</strong>. This implies the capacity for <strong>Reason</strong> and <strong>Reflective Thought</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Why it is Necessary:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Knowledge of the End:</strong> To act morally, one must be able to conceive of a goal (the 'End') and understand the means to achieve it.</li>
            <li><strong>Deliberation:</strong> A moral agent does not act solely on blind instinct (like an animal). They have the mental capacity to weigh different motives, compare alternatives, and foresee consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Conscious Choice:</strong> Morality requires a 'conscious' movement of the mind toward a chosen value.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="spap_freedomWill">
        <h2>4. Freedom of the Will</h2>
        <p>This is considered the <strong>central postulate</strong> of ethics. As Immanuel Kant famously stated, <em>"Ought implies Can."</em> If I say you "ought" to do something, it logically implies that you have the <strong>freedom</strong> to do it or not do it.</p>

        <h3>Dimensions of Freedom:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Determination:</strong> Freedom does not mean "acting without a cause." It means the action is caused by the agent's own character and will, rather than by external physical force.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice between Alternatives:</strong> There must be at least two possible paths. If a person is forced at gunpoint or by a physical machine to move their hand, that movement is not a "free act" and thus not a "moral act."</li>
            <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> We only praise or punish people for actions they were free to avoid. If human actions were strictly determined like the movements of a clock, morality would be impossible.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-section">
            <h4>Exam Focus: Tips & FAQs</h4>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Can there be morality without Freedom of the Will?</strong><br>
            A: No. If our actions are 100% determined by biology or fate (Determinism), then blaming someone for a crime or praising them for a hero's act would be as irrational as praising a stone for falling or a river for flowing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between Self-consciousness and Mental life?</strong><br>
            A: <em>Self-consciousness</em> refers to the awareness of the "I" as a persistent agent. <em>Mental life</em> refers to the active processes of reasoning, weighing motives, and reflecting on values.</p>

            <h3>Exam Tip</h3>
            <p>When discussing <strong>Freedom of the Will</strong>, always mention the phrase "Moral Responsibility." Freedom is the ground of responsibility. If the will is not free, the agent is not responsible.</p>
