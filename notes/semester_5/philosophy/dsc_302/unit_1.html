    <section id="spap_characteristics">
        <h2>1. Characteristics of Modern Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Modern Philosophy (beginning roughly in the 17th century) represents a shift away from the <strong>Scholasticism</strong> of the Middle Ages. Its primary features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Autonomy of Reason:</strong> Reason is seen as the primary tool for seeking truth, independent of religious authority or tradition.</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific Spirit:</strong> A deep influence from the nascent physical sciences (Newton, Galileo), emphasizing observation and mathematics.</li>
            <li><strong>Subjective Turn:</strong> A new focus on the human mind and how we know things (Epistemology).</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Outlook:</strong> A willingness to doubt and re-evaluate established dogmas.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="spap_bacon">
        <h2>2. Francis Bacon (Empiricism)</h2>
        <p>Bacon is often called the "Father of Experimental Philosophy." He sought to replace the abstract logic of Aristotle with a method that would allow humans to master nature.</p>

        <h3>The Inductive Method</h3>
        <p>Bacon advocated for <strong>Induction</strong>—gathering specific observations and moving toward general laws—over <em>Deduction</em> (starting with a general premise).</p>

        <h3>The Four Idols of the Mind</h3>
        <p>Bacon identified four prejudices or "Idols" that distort human understanding:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Idols of the Tribe:</strong> Errors inherent in human nature (e.g., seeing patterns where none exist).</li>
            <li><strong>Idols of the Cave:</strong> Personal prejudices stemming from one's upbringing, education, or environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Idols of the Marketplace:</strong> Errors caused by the imprecise use of language and social interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Idols of the Theatre:</strong> False dogmas of philosophies and systems of thought that create a "theatrical" or fake world.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="spap_descartes">
        <h2>3. René Descartes (Rationalism)</h2>
        <p>Descartes is the founder of Modern Rationalism. He aimed to find a foundation for knowledge that was as certain as geometry.</p>

        <h3>The Method of Doubt</h3>
        <p>To reach certainty, Descartes decided to doubt everything that could possibly be doubted (the senses, the external world, even mathematics) until he found something <strong>indubitable</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Cogito Ergo Sum</h3>
        <p>Descartes discovered that he could doubt everything except the fact that he was doubting. Doubting is a form of thinking, and thinking requires a thinker. This led to his famous first principle:</p>
        <blockquote>"I think, therefore I am" (<em>Cogito Ergo Sum</em>)</blockquote>

        <h3>Criteria of Truth</h3>
        <p>Descartes established that whatever the mind perceives <strong>clearly and distinctly</strong> must be true. This became his yardstick for all further knowledge, including his proofs for the existence of God and the external world.</p>

            <h4>Exam Focus: Tips & FAQs</h4>
            
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: What is the main difference between Bacon and Descartes?</strong><br>
            A: Bacon emphasized <strong>Empiricism</strong> (knowledge through sensory experience and induction), while Descartes emphasized <strong>Rationalism</strong> (knowledge through reason and deduction).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Why is Descartes called the 'Father of Modern Philosophy'?</strong><br>
            A: Because he centered philosophy on the <em>Subject</em> (the "I" or the self) rather than the external world or God, setting the agenda for all future modern thinkers.</p>

            <h3>Exam Tip</h3>
            <p>In your answers, remember that for Bacon, <strong>"Knowledge is Power."</strong> He believed the goal of philosophy was the practical benefit of humanity through the control of nature.</p>
