        <h2 id="ordinary">1. <span id="span_34">Law Making Procedure: Ordinary Bill</span></h2>
        <p>An Ordinary Bill is any bill that is not a Money Bill or a Constitution Amendment Bill. It can be introduced in either House of Parliament.</p>
        
        <h3>Stages of an Ordinary Bill:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First Reading:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bill is introduced by a Minister or a Private Member.</li>
                    <li>The member reads the title and objectives of the bill.</li>
                    <li>No discussion takes place. The bill is published in the Gazette of India.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Second Reading:</strong> This is the most important stage.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stage of General Discussion:</strong> The principles of the bill are discussed, but not the specific clauses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Committee Stage:</strong> The bill is usually referred to a <strong>Select Committee</strong> of the house or a <strong>Joint Committee</strong> of both houses, or a <strong>Departmental Standing Committee</strong>. <span id="span_35">The committee examines the bill clause by clause.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Consideration Stage:</strong> The House considers the bill clause by clause, along with the report of the committee. Amendments can be moved and voted upon.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Third Reading:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The debate is restricted to arguments for or against the bill as a whole.</li>
                    <li>No major amendments are allowed.</li>
                    <li>If the bill is passed by a simple majority (majority of members present and voting), it is sent to the other House.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bill in the Other House:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bill goes through all three stages again in the other House.</li>
                    <li>The other House can: (a) pass the bill, (b) pass it with amendments (and return it to the first House), (c) reject it, or (d) take no action.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Deadlock:</strong> If there is a disagreement between the two Houses for 6 months, the President can summon a <strong>Joint Sitting</strong> (Art 108). The bill is then passed by a simple majority of the total members of both Houses present and voting.</li>
            <li><strong>Assent of the President:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once passed by both Houses, the bill is presented to the President.</li>
                    <li>The President can: (a) give his assent (it becomes an Act), (b) withhold his assent, or (c) return the bill for reconsideration (if it is not a Money Bill).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="financial">2. <span id="span_36">Law Making Procedure: Financial Bill</span></h2>
        <p>Financial bills deal with revenue and expenditure. The most important type is the <strong>Money Bill</strong>, defined in Article 110.</p>
        
        <h3>Special Procedure for Money Bills (Art 109)</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>What is a Money Bill?</strong> A bill dealing *only* with matters like taxation, government borrowing, or expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. The <strong>Speaker of the Lok Sabha</strong> has the final power to certify if a bill is a Money Bill.
        </blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> A Money Bill can <strong>only</strong> be introduced in the <strong>Lok Sabha</strong>, and only with the prior recommendation of the President.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Rajya Sabha:</strong> After being passed by the Lok Sabha, it is sent to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha has very limited powers:
                <ul>
                    <li>It <strong>cannot reject or amend</strong> a Money Bill.</li>
                    <li>It can only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject.</li>
                    <li>It must return the bill within <strong>14 days</strong>. If it fails to do so, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assent of the President:</strong> The President usually gives his assent to a Money Bill (as it was introduced with his permission). He cannot return it for reconsideration.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="amendment">3. <span id="span_37">Constitution Amendment Procedure</span></h2>
        <p>The procedure for amending the Constitution is laid down in <strong>Article 368</strong>. <span id="span_38"><span id="span_39">It is a mix of rigidity and flexibility.</span></span></p>
