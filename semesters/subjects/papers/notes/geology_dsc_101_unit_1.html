        <h2 id="topic1">Geology and its different branches</h2>
        
        <h3>What is Geology?</h3>
        <p>Geology (from the Greek <em>geo</em>, meaning "Earth," and <em>logos</em>, meaning "study of") is the science that studies the Earth, its composition, structure, physical properties, history, and the processes that shape it.</p>
        <p>It's an Earth science that seeks to understand all aspects of our planet, from its molten core to the rocks on its surface, and even its history of life as preserved in fossils.</p>

        <h3>Main Branches of Geology</h3>
        <p>Geology is a broad field, typically divided into two main areas: <strong>Physical Geology</strong> and <strong>Historical Geology</strong>. These are supported by many specialized branches.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Geology:</strong> Studies the materials that make up the Earth (like minerals and rocks) and the processes that operate beneath and upon its surface.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mineralogy:</strong> The study of minerals (their structure, chemistry, physical properties).</li>
                    <li><strong>Petrology:</strong> The study of rocks (igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic) and their formation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Geology:</strong> The study of the deformation of Earth's crust (folds, faults, and other structures).</li>
                    <li><strong>Geomorphology:</strong> The study of landforms and the surface processes that create them (erosion, weathering, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Historical Geology:</strong> Studies the origin and evolution of the Earth, its continents, oceans, atmosphere, and life.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stratigraphy:</strong> The study of layered rocks (strata) to understand the sequence of events in Earth's history.</li>
                    <li><strong>Palaeontology:</strong> The study of fossils (the remains of ancient life) to understand the history of life on Earth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other Specialized Branches:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Geochemistry:</strong> Study of the chemical composition of the Earth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Geophysics:</strong> Study of the physical properties of the Earth (e.g., magnetism, gravity, seismic waves).</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydrogeology:</strong> Study of groundwater.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Geology:</strong> Study and exploration of Earth's economic resources (minerals, oil, gas, coal).</li>
                    <li><strong>Engineering Geology:</strong> Application of geological knowledge for engineering projects (dams, tunnels, buildings).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Scope of Geology</h2>
        <p>The scope of geology is vast, impacting various aspects of science, economy, and society. Its primary applications include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Resource Exploration:</strong> Finding and managing natural resources like:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Energy Resources:</strong> Fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) and geothermal energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mineral Resources:</strong> Economic minerals and ores (e.g., iron, copper, gold, diamonds).</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Resources:</strong> Locating and managing groundwater (hydrogeology), which is crucial for drinking water and agriculture.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hazard Mitigation:</strong> Understanding and predicting natural hazards to save lives and property. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Earthquakes (Seismology)</li>
                    <li>Volcanic eruptions</li>
                    <li>Landslides</li>
                    <li>Floods</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Civil Engineering:</strong> Providing essential information for construction projects. Geologists assess the stability of the ground for building dams, bridges, tunnels, roads, and large buildings.</li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Academic and Scientific Understanding:</strong> Answering fundamental questions about the Earth's origin, the origin of life, and the dynamics of our planet (like plate tectonics).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic3">Geological Time Scale (GTS)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> The Geological Time Scale (GTS) is a "calendar" of Earth's history. It chronologically organizes all of Earth's 4.6-billion-year history into different time units based on major geological events and the appearance or extinction of life forms.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Major Divisions of the GTS</h3>
        <p>The GTS is hierarchical, divided into units of decreasing duration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eons:</strong> The largest time divisions. Earth's history is divided into four Eons:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hadean Eon:</strong> The "hellish" period of Earth's formation (4.6 to 4.0 billion years ago).</li>
                    <li><strong>Archean Eon:</strong> When the first single-celled life (bacteria) appeared (4.0 to 2.5 billion years ago).</li>
                    <li><strong>Proterozoic Eon:</strong> When complex single-celled life and the first multicellular life appeared (2.5 billion to 541 million years ago).</li>
                    <li><strong>Phanerozoic Eon:</strong> The Eon of "visible life" (541 million years ago to present), which is what we are most familiar with.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> The Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic Eons are collectively known as the <strong>Precambrian</strong>, which accounts for about 88% of Earth's history.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Eras:</strong> The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three Eras:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Paleozoic Era ("Ancient Life"):</strong> Age of Invertebrates, Fishes, and Amphibians. (541 to 252 million years ago).</li>
                    <li><strong>Mesozoic Era ("Middle Life"):</strong> Age of Reptiles (dinosaurs). (252 to 66 million years ago).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cenozoic Era ("Recent Life"):</strong> Age of Mammals. (66 million years ago to present).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Periods:</strong> Each Era is further subdivided into Periods (e.g., the Mesozoic Era includes the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods).</li>
            <li><strong>Epochs:</strong> Periods are subdivided into Epochs (e.g., we live in the Holocene Epoch).</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> You <em>must</em> memorize the three Eras of the Phanerozoic Eon and their corresponding Periods. A common mnemonic for the Periods (oldest to youngest) is:
            <br>
            <strong>"<u>C</u></strong>ambrian, <strong><u>O</u></strong>rdovician, <strong><u>S</u></strong>ilurian, <strong><u>D</u></strong>evonian, <strong><u>C</u></strong>arboniferous, <strong><u>P</u></strong>ermian, <strong><u>T</u></strong>riassic, <strong><u>J</u></strong>urassic, <strong><u>C</u></strong>retaceous, <strong><u>P</u></strong>aleogene, <strong><u>N</u></strong>eogene, <strong><u>Q</u></strong>uaternary."
            <br>
            (Mnemonic: "<strong>C</strong>amels <strong>O</strong>ften <strong>S</strong>it <strong>D</strong>own <strong>C</strong>arefully, <strong>P</strong>erhaps <strong>T</strong>heir <strong>J</strong>oints <strong>C</strong>reak? <strong>P</strong>aleo-<strong>N</strong>eo-<strong>Q</strong>uaternary.")
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic4">Solar System</h2>
        <p>Our Solar System consists of the <strong>Sun</strong> (our star) and everything bound to it by gravity. This includes planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other icy bodies.</p>
        
        <h3>Components of the Solar System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Sun:</strong> A star that contains 99.8% of all the mass in the Solar System. Its gravity holds the system together.</li>
            <li><strong>Planets:</strong> The eight planets are divided into two groups:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Terrestrial Planets (Inner Planets):</strong> Small, dense, and rocky.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mercury</li>
                            <li>Venus</li>
                            <li>Earth</li>
                            <li>Mars</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Jovian Planets (Outer Planets or Gas Giants):</strong> Large, low-density, and composed mainly of gas (hydrogen, helium) and ice.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Jupiter</li>
                            <li>Saturn</li>
                            <li>Uranus</li>
                            <li>Neptune</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other Bodies:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asteroid Belt:</strong> A region between Mars and Jupiter containing millions of rocky objects (asteroids).</li>
                    <li><strong>Kuiper Belt:</strong> A region beyond Neptune containing icy bodies, including dwarf planets like Pluto.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oort Cloud:</strong> A hypothetical, vast spherical shell of comets at the outermost edge of our Solar System.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5">Theories of origin of the Earth</h2>
        <p>These theories explain how our Solar System, including Earth, came into existence. The most widely accepted theory is the Nebular Hypothesis.</p>

        <h3>Nebular Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>This is the modern, standard model for the formation of the Solar System. It was first proposed by Immanuel Kant (1755) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1796).</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with a Nebula:</strong> The Solar System began as a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust called a <strong>solar nebula</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Gravitational Collapse:</strong> This nebula began to collapse under its own gravity. It's possible a nearby event, like a supernova (exploding star), triggered this collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Spinning Disk:</strong> As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin faster and faster, flattening into a rotating disk (like a pizza spinning in the air). This is called a <strong>protoplanetary disk</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Formation of the Sun:</strong> Gravity pulled most of the gas (hydrogen and helium) into the center. The pressure and temperature became so high that nuclear fusion began, and the <strong>Sun</strong> was born.</li>
            <li><strong>Formation of Planets (Accretion):</strong> In the surrounding disk, dust particles began to stick together (accretion).
                <ul>
                    <li>These clumps grew into pebble-sized bodies, then boulder-sized, and eventually into kilometers-wide <strong>planetesimals</strong>.</li>
                    <li>These planetesimals collided and merged, growing larger over millions of years to form <strong>protoplanets</strong>, which eventually "cleared their orbits" to become the planets we see today.</li>
                    <li>Near the hot, central Sun, only rocky and metallic materials could condense, forming the <strong>terrestrial planets</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Farther out, where it was colder, Ices (water, methane, ammonia) could also condense, allowing the <strong>Jovian planets</strong> to grow massive and capture huge amounts of gas.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Context - Big Bang Theory:</strong> Don't confuse the origin of the <em>Earth</em> with the origin of the <em>Universe</em>. The <strong>Big Bang Theory</strong> explains the origin of the entire universe (space, time, and matter) about 13.8 billion years ago. The Nebular Hypothesis explains the formation of our specific Solar System, which happened much later (about 4.6 billion years ago).
