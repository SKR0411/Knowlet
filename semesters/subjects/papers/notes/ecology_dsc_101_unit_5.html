            <h2>1. Introduction to Biogeochemical Cycles</h2>
            <p>Unlike energy, which flows <strong>one-way</strong> through an ecosystem and is lost as heat, matter (chemical elements) is <strong>cycled</strong>. Nutrients are finite and must be recycled for life to continue.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Biogeochemical Cycle:</strong> The pathway by which a chemical element (like Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus) moves through the <strong>bio-</strong> (living), <strong>geo-</strong> (earth, rocks, soil), and <strong>chemo-</strong> (chemical) components of an ecosystem.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Each cycle has two main parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reservoir Pool:</strong> The large, slow-moving, often abiotic part of the cycle where the nutrient is stored. (e.g., the atmosphere for Carbon, rocks for Phosphorus).</li>
                <li><strong>Cycling Pool:</strong> The smaller, more active, biotic part of the cycle where the nutrient moves quickly between organisms and their immediate environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Cycles:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gaseous Cycles:</strong> The main reservoir is the atmosphere or ocean. These cycles are global.
                    <ul><li><strong>Examples:</strong> Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Water.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sedimentary Cycles:</strong> The main reservoir is the Earth's crust (rocks and soil). These cycles are slower and more localized.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Phosphorus.</li></ul>

            <h2>2. The Hydrological (Water) Cycle</h2>
            <p>This is the continuous movement of water (H₂O) on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is a physical process, not a chemical one, driven by solar energy.</p>
            <p>Key Processes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> Solar energy heats liquid water, turning it into water vapor (gas) and rising into the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Water vapor in the air cools and changes back into liquid water, forming clouds.</li>
                <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Water is released from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</li>
                <li><strong>Collection/Runoff:</strong> Water that falls on land flows over the surface (<strong>surface runoff</strong>) into rivers, lakes, and oceans, or soaks into the ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Infiltration/Percolation:</strong> Water soaks into the soil and moves downward to become <strong>groundwater</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Transpiration:</strong> The release of water vapor from plants into the atmosphere (a form of biological evaporation).</li>

            <h2>3. The Carbon Cycle (Gaseous)</h2>
            <p>Carbon is the basis of all organic molecules. The main reservoir of carbon is <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere</strong> and dissolved in the oceans.</p>
            <p>Key Processes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria pull CO₂ from the atmosphere and use it to make organic compounds (sugar/biomass). This is the key process that "fixes" carbon.</li>
                <li><strong>Respiration:</strong> All living organisms (plants, animals, decomposers) break down organic compounds for energy, releasing CO₂ back into the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Decomposers (bacteria, fungi) break down dead organic matter, releasing CO₂ through respiration.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumption:</strong> Carbon is transferred from producers to consumers when they are eaten.</li>
                <li><strong>Combustion:</strong> The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and wood releases vast amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere as CO₂. This is the main driver of modern climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Sedimentation:</strong> Over millions of years, dead organic matter that fails to decompose can be buried and converted into <strong>fossil fuels</strong>, locking carbon away. Shells and skeletons (calcium carbonate) can form limestone.</li>

            <h2>4. The Nitrogen Cycle (Gaseous)</h2>
            <p>Nitrogen is essential for making proteins and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA). The main reservoir is <strong>N₂ gas in the atmosphere</strong> (which makes up ~78% of the air). However, most organisms cannot use N₂ gas directly.</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> N₂ gas is "unavailable" because of its strong triple bond. It must be "fixed" into a usable form, like ammonia (NH₃) or nitrate (NO₃⁻).</p>
            <p>Key Processes (driven by bacteria):</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fixation:</strong> The conversion of N₂ gas into ammonia (NH₃).
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Biological:</strong> Done by specific bacteria (e.g., <em>Rhizobium</em> in the root nodules of legumes like beans and peas; <em>Azotobacter</em> in the soil).</li>
                        <li><strong>Atmospheric:</strong> Lightning has enough energy to split N₂ gas, forming nitrogen oxides.</li>
                        <li><strong>Industrial:</strong> The Haber-Bosch process manufactures fertilizer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nitrification:</strong> A two-step process, done by nitrifying bacteria, converting ammonia into nitrates, which plants can easily absorb.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>Nitrosomonas</em> bacteria convert Ammonia (NH₃) → Nitrite (NO₂⁻).</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Nitrobacter</em> bacteria convert Nitrite (NO₂⁻) → Nitrate (NO₃⁻).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Assimilation:</strong> Plants absorb usable nitrogen (nitrates or ammonia) from the soil and incorporate it into their own proteins and DNA. Animals get nitrogen by eating plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Ammonification:</strong> Decomposers (bacteria, fungi) break down dead organic matter (waste, dead organisms) and convert the organic nitrogen back into ammonia (NH₃).</li>
                <li><strong>Denitrification:</strong> The conversion of nitrates (NO₃⁻) back into N₂ gas, which returns to the atmosphere. This is done by denitrifying bacteria (e.g., <em>Pseudomonas</em>) in anaerobic (low-oxygen) conditions, like waterlogged soil.</li>

            <h2>5. The Phosphorus Cycle (Sedimentary)</h2>
            <p>Phosphorus is essential for DNA, RNA, ATP (the energy molecule), and cell membranes.
            <p><strong>Main Reservoir:</strong> The main reservoir is in <strong>phosphate rock (sedimentary rock)</strong> on land and in the ocean floor. There is no significant gaseous component (it does *not* go into the atmosphere).</p>
            <p>Key Processes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Weathering:</strong> Rain and erosion slowly break down phosphate rocks, releasing phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) into the soil and water. This is a very slow process.</li>
                <li><strong>Assimilation (Uptake):</strong> Plants absorb dissolved phosphate from the soil. Animals get phosphorus by eating plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Decomposition (Mineralization):</strong> Decomposers break down dead organic matter, returning phosphate to the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Sedimentation:</strong> Phosphate that washes into the oceans can settle to the bottom and, over millions of years, form new sedimentary rock. This "locks away" the phosphorus for a very long time.</li>
                <li><strong>Geological Uplift:</strong> The process of mountain-building that brings the deep ocean sediments and rocks back to the surface, making the phosphate available for weathering again (this takes eons).</li>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because this cycle is so slow and depends on weathering, phosphorus is often a <strong>limiting nutrient</strong> for plant growth, both on land and in freshwater. This is why fertilizers (N-P-K) are rich in phosphorus.</p>

            <h2>6. The Sulphur Cycle (Gaseous)</h2>
            <p>Sulphur is important for some amino acids (proteins). This cycle is complex, having both gaseous and sedimentary components.</p>
            <p><strong>Reservoirs:</strong> Rocks, soils, and the atmosphere (as Sulphur Dioxide, SO₂).</p>
            <p>Key Processes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Weathering/Decomposition:</strong> Sulphur in rocks (like pyrite) is weathered, and decomposition of organic matter releases sulphur, often as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S - rotten egg smell).</li>
                <li><strong>Assimilation:</strong> Plants absorb sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻) from the soil and incorporate them into proteins.</li>
                <li><strong>Volcanic Activity:</strong> Volcanoes are a major natural source of atmospheric Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂).</li>
                <li><strong>Atmospheric Conversion:</strong> In the atmosphere, SO₂ and H₂S react with oxygen and water to form sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄).</li>
                <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> The sulphuric acid falls to Earth as <strong>acid rain</strong>, which can harm forests and lakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Impact (Combustion):</strong> The burning of <strong>fossil fuels</strong> (especially coal) releases massive amounts of SO₂ into the atmosphere, and is the primary cause of industrial acid rain.</li>

            <h2>7. Nutrient Cycling in Ecosystems</h2>
            <p>This topic describes the processes that control the movement and storage of nutrients *within* an ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h3>Input of Nutrients in Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Nutrients must first enter the ecosystem. This happens through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atmospheric Input:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wet deposition:</strong> Nutrients dissolved in rain and snow (e.g., nitrogen and sulphur from acid rain).</li>
                        <li><strong>Dry deposition:</strong> Nutrients that fall as dust or airborne particles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gaseous fixation:</strong> e.g., Nitrogen fixation by bacteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Weathering:</strong> The breakdown of parent rock (the "geological" part) releases nutrients like phosphorus and calcium into the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Biological Input:</strong> Migrating animals may bring in nutrients (e.g., salmon migrating upstream, dying, and decomposing).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Biotic Accumulation</h3>
            <p>This is the process of nutrients being take
