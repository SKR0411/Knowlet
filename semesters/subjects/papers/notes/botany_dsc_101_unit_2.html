        <h3>Virus Stature</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Viruses:</strong> Acellular, non-living entities that are <strong>obligate intracellular parasites</strong>. They lack their own metabolic machinery and must hijack a host cell to replicate.
        </blockquote>
        <p>They consist of a nucleic acid core (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat (capsid). They are "infectious particles" rather than organisms.</p>
        
        <h3>Classification (Baltimore)</h3>
        <p>The Baltimore Classification system (proposed by David Baltimore) is a fundamental concept. It classifies viruses into <strong>seven groups</strong> based on their type of genome and how they produce messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein synthesis.</p>

            <strong>Key Concept:</strong> (+)ssRNA (Group IV) can be directly translated by the host ribosome, acting just like mRNA. (-)ssRNA (Group V) must first be transcribed into (+)ssRNA by a viral enzyme (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) before translation.

        <h2 id="topic2">General Structure and Replication</h2>
        <h3>General Structure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genome:</strong> The genetic material, either DNA or RNA, single or double-stranded.</li>
            <li><strong>Capsid:</strong> A protein coat surrounding the genome. It's made of subunits called <strong>capsomeres</strong>. The capsid protects the genome and helps it attach to the host cell.</li>
            <li><strong>Envelope (Optional):</strong> A lipid membrane derived from the host cell that surrounds the capsid in some viruses (e.g., Influenza, HIV). Viruses without it are "naked" viruses.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: Structure of a Naked (e.g., T-phage) and an Enveloped (e.g., Influenza) Virus]</strong>
        </div>

        <h3>General Replication Cycle (Lytic)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Attachment:</strong> The virus binds to specific receptors on the host cell surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Penetration/Entry:</strong> The virus or its genome enters the host cell (e.g., by injection, endocytosis, or membrane fusion).</li>
            <li><strong>Uncoating:</strong> The capsid is removed, releasing the viral genome.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthesis (Replication & Protein Production):</strong> The host cell's machinery is hijacked to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Replicate the viral genome.</li>
                    <li>Transcribe viral genes into mRNA.</li>
                    <li>Translate the mRNA into viral proteins (capsid proteins, enzymes).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assembly (Maturation):</strong> New viral genomes are packaged into newly made capsids to form new virus particles (virions).</li>
            <li><strong>Release:</strong> The new virions exit the host cell, often by <strong>lysis</strong> (bursting) the cell or by <strong>budding</strong> (for enveloped viruses).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic3">Plant Viruses - TMV</h2>
        <h3>Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)</h3>
        <p>TMV is a classic example of a plant virus and was the first virus to be discovered and crystallized.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> It is a rod-shaped, naked virus. Its capsid is a <strong>helix</strong> made of thousands of identical capsomere proteins.</li>
            <li><strong>Genome:</strong> It has a <strong>(+)ssRNA</strong> genome (Baltimore Group IV).</li>
            <li><strong>Disease:</strong> It causes Tobacco Mosaic Disease, characterized by "mosaic" patterns (light/dark green patches) and mottling on the leaves of tobacco, tomato, and other plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> It is extremely stable and transmitted mechanically (e.g., on contaminated tools, hands, or by infected plant sap). It is not typically spread by insects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Bacteriophage (T-phage Lytic and Lysogenic cycle)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Bacteriophage (or Phage):</strong> A virus that infects and replicates within bacteria.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>T-phages</strong> (e.g., T4 phage) are "T-even" phages that infect <em>E. coli</em>. They have a complex structure: an icosahedral "head" (containing dsDNA) and a "tail" assembly (sheath, base plate, tail fibers).</p>
        
        <p>Phages can have two main life cycles:</p>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: Lytic vs. Lysogenic Cycles]</strong>
        </div>
        
        <h3>1. Lytic Cycle (Virulent)</h3>
        <p>This is a "slash and burn" cycle that ends in the death of the host cell.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Attachment:</strong> Tail fibers attach to specific receptors on the <em>E. coli</em> cell wall.</li>
            <li><strong>Penetration:</strong> The tail sheath contracts, injecting the phage's dsDNA into the bacterium. The capsid stays outside.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthesis:</strong> The phage DNA takes over. It directs synthesis of phage DNA and phage proteins. Host DNA is degraded.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> New phage heads, tails, and fibers are assembled, and DNA is packaged into the heads.</li>
            <li><strong>Release:</strong> The phage produces an enzyme (lysozyme) that degrades the bacterial cell wall, causing the cell to <strong>lyse (burst)</strong> and release hundreds of new phages.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Lysogenic Cycle (Temperate)</h3>
        <p>This is a "stealth" cycle where the phage co-exists with the host.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Attachment & Penetration:</strong> Same as the lytic cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Instead of taking over, the phage DNA <strong>integrates</strong> into the bacterial chromosome. The integrated phage DNA is now called a <strong>prophage</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Replication:</strong> The prophage is dormant. It is copied and passed on to daughter cells every time the bacterium divides. The bacterium is now <strong>lysogenic</strong> (carrying the prophage).</li>
            <li><strong>Induction:</strong> The prophage can later be "induced" (e.g., by stress like UV light) to exit the bacterial chromosome and enter the lytic cycle, leading to synthesis, assembly, and lysis.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic5">Methods of Isolation of Plant Viruses</h2>
        <p>Viruses cannot be grown on artificial media. They must be cultured in living host cells.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mechanical Inoculation:</strong> The most common method. An extract from an infected plant (sap) is prepared and simply rubbed onto the leaves of a healthy indicator plant, often with a mild abrasive (like carborundum) to create tiny wounds for the virus to enter.</li>
            <li><strong>Grafting:</strong> An infected piece of plant (scion) is grafted onto a healthy plant (stock).</li>
            <li><strong>Vector Transmission:</strong> Using the natural insect vector (e.g., aphids) to feed on an infected plant and then transfer to a healthy one.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After inoculation, the viruses are "isolated" by observing symptoms or by purifying the virus particles from the plant tissue using centrifugation and chemical precipitation.</p>

        <h2 id="topic6">Economic Importance of Viruses</h2>
        <p>Viruses have significant negative and positive economic impacts.</p>
        <h3>Negative Importance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Disease:</strong> Cause countless diseases (e.g., influenza, HIV/AIDS, COVID-19), leading to healthcare costs and loss of productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Plant Disease:</strong> Major crop losses (e.g., TMV, Citrus tristeza virus).</li>
            <li><strong>Animal Disease:</strong> Impact livestock (e.g., Foot-and-mouth disease, Avian influenza).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Positive Importance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic Engineering:</strong> Viruses (especially bacteriophages and retroviruses) are used as <strong>vectors</strong> to carry desired genes into cells for gene therapy and biotechnology.</li>
            <li><strong>Phage Therapy:</strong> Using bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections, especially those resistant to antibiotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Control:</strong> Using viruses (e.comg., baculoviruses) as highly specific biopesticides to control insect pests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic7">Bacteria: General Characteristics and Classification</h2>
        <h3>General Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Ribosomes:</strong> Have 70S ribosomes (different from eukaryotic 80S).</li>
            <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Asexual, primarily by <strong>binary fission</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Classification (Major Groups)</h3>
        <p>Classification can be based on morphology (shape), Gram stain, or (most accurately) molecular data (rRNA sequencing).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Based on Shape:</strong>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Gram-Negative:</strong> Thin peptidoglycan wall + outer lipid membrane (e.g., <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Rhizobium</em>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Major Phyla (Molecular):</strong>

                    <li><strong>Proteobacteria:</strong> Large, diverse group of Gram-negatives (includes <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Rhizobium</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Firmicutes:</strong> Gram-positives with low G+C content (includes <em>Bacillus</em>, <em>Lactobacillus</em>).</li>

        <p>Direct, cell-to-cell transfer of DNA (usually a plasmid) via a <strong>sex pilus</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>F+ to F- Transfer:</strong> An <strong>F+ cell</strong> (donor) has the F (fertility) plasmid. It forms a pilus, attaches to an <strong>F- cell</strong> (recipient), and transfers a copy of the F plasmid. The F- cell becomes F+.</li>
            <li><strong>Hfr (High Frequency of Recombination):</strong> If the F plasmid integrates into the bacterial chromosome, the cell is called Hfr. When an Hfr cell conjugates, it tries to transfer its entire chromosome (with the F plasmid inside) to an F- cell.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Transformation</h3>
        <p>The uptake and incorporation of <strong>"naked" DNA</strong> (fragments from dead, lysed cells) from the environment. This was famously demonstrated in <strong>Griffith's experiment</strong> with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Transduction</h3>
        <p>The transfer of bacterial DNA from one cell to another via a <strong>bacteriophage (virus)</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
