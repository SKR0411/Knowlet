            <h2>1. Introduction to Ecology</h2>
            <p>Ecology is the scientific study of the relationships and interactions between organisms and their environment. The term "ecology" was coined by the German biologist <strong>Ernst Haeckel</strong> in 1866, derived from the Greek words <em>Oikos</em> (meaning 'house' or 'dwelling') and <em>Logos</em> (meaning 'study').</p>
            <p>The environment includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biotic factors:</strong> All the living components, such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Abiotic factors:</strong> All the non-living chemical and physical components, such as sunlight, temperature, water, soil, and wind.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ecology seeks to understand the distribution, abundance, and interactions of organisms, and the flow of energy and materials within ecosystems.</p>

        <section id="levels">
            <h2>2. Levels of Organization</h2>
            <p>Ecology studies life at various levels of complexity. These levels are hierarchical, meaning each level builds upon the one before it.</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A pyramid or flowchart showing the levels of ecological organization, starting from the individual organism and building up to the biosphere.
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Organism (Individual):</strong> The fundamental unit of ecology. It studies how an individual organism adapts to its environment (morphology, physiology, behavior).</li>
                <li><strong>Population:</strong> A group of individuals of the <strong>same species</strong> living in the same area at the same time. Ecology at this level focuses on population size, density, growth, and regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> A group of different populations (<strong>different species</strong>) interacting in a specific area. This level focuses on species interactions (e.g., predation, competition).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> The community of living organisms (biotic) interacting with their non-living (abiotic) environment as a system. This level focuses on <strong>energy flow</strong> and <strong>nutrient cycling</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Biome:</strong> A large collection of ecosystems that share similar climatic conditions and have a dominant type of vegetation. Examples include tundra, desert, rainforest, and grasslands.</li>
                <li><strong>Biosphere:</strong> The highest level of organization. It is the sum of all parts of the Earth where life exists, including land, water, and the atmosphere.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be able to clearly define each level and explain the key difference between them. For example, a <strong>population</strong> is single-species, while a <strong>community</strong> is multi-species. An <strong>ecosystem</strong> adds the abiotic factors to the community.

        <section id="habitat-niche">
            <h2>3. Habitat and Ecological Niche</h2>
            <p>These two concepts are fundamental but often confused. They describe an organism's place in the environment.</p>
            
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>The habitat is the physical place or environment where an organism lives. It's the organism's "address." It provides all the resources the organism needs to survive, such as food, water, and shelter.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The habitat of a polar bear is the Arctic sea ice. The habitat of a pitcher plant is a nutrient-poor bog.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ecological Niche</h3>
            <p>The ecological niche is a more complex concept. It describes the <strong>functional role</strong> and position of a species within an ecosystem. It includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What it eats (its trophic level).</li>
                <li>Who eats it.</li>
                <li>Its relationships with other species (e.g., competition, mutualism).</li>
                <li>Its tolerance to abiotic factors (e.g., temperature range, humidity).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short, the niche is the organism's "profession" or "lifestyle."</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>G.E. Hutchinson (1957)</strong> defined the niche as an "n-dimensional hypervolume," where each dimension represents an environmental factor or resource required by the species.
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Types of Niches:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fundamental Niche:</strong> The full range of environmental conditions and resources an organism could *potentially* occupy and use, in the <em>absence</em> of competition from other species.</li>
                <li><strong>Realized Niche:</strong> The part of the fundamental niche that an organism *actually* occupies as a result of limiting factors, especially competition. The realized niche is always smaller than or equal to the fundamental niche.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> Two overlapping circles. One large circle represents the Fundamental Niche of Species A. A smaller circle inside it, partially overlapped by the Fundamental Niche of Species B, represents the Realized Niche of Species A.
            </div>

            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Common Question:</strong> Differentiate between habitat and niche.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Habitat</strong> = Address (Where it lives)</li>
                    <li><strong>Niche</strong> = Profession (What it does, its role, and its resource requirements)</li>
                    <li>Analogy: A single habitat (like an apartment building) can contain many different niches (plumber, teacher, artist), just as a single tree (habitat) can support many insect species (niches).</li>

        <section id="stability">
            <h2>4. Ecosystem Stability: Resistance & Resilience</h2>
            <p>Ecosystem stability refers to the ability of an ecosystem to maintain its structure and function over time, especially when faced with disturbances (like fires, floods, or pollution).</p>
            <p>Stability has two main components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> The ability of an ecosystem to <strong>avoid displacement or change</strong> when faced with a disturbance. A highly resistant ecosystem changes very little.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> A mature forest with large trees may be highly resistant to a mild windstorm.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> The ability of an ecosystem to <strong>recover quickly</strong> and return to its original state *after* it has been disturbed.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> A grassland may not be resistant to fire (it burns easily), but it is very resilient and grows back quickly within a few weeks or months.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A graph of "Ecosystem State" vs. "Time."
                <br>1. <strong>Resistant system:</strong> A disturbance occurs (a dip), but the dip is very shallow.
                <br>2. <strong>Resilient system:</strong> A disturbance occurs (a deep dip), but the line quickly returns to the original level.
                <br>3. <strong>Non-stable system:</strong> A disturbance occurs (a deep dip), and the line settles at a new, lower level (a "regime shift").
            </div>
            <p>An ecosystem can be resistant but not resilient, or resilient but not resistant. For example, a coral reef is resistant to small waves but has very low resilience if it gets bleached by high temperatures (it takes decades to recover).</p>

            <h2>5. Branches of Ecology: Autecology & Synecology</h2>
            <p>Ecology can be broadly divided based on the level of organization being studied.</p>
            
            <h3>Autecology (Species Ecology)</h3>
            <p>This is the study of a <strong>single species</strong> (or individual organism) and its relationship with its environment. It focuses on the adaptations, life history, and population dynamics of that one species.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Questions asked:</strong> What is the temperature tolerance of this plant? How does this animal find a mate? What factors limit the population size of this specific butterfly?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Synecology (Community Ecology)</h3>
            <p>This is the study of <strong>groups of organisms</strong> (communities) and their relationships with each other and their environment. It focuses on the composition, structure, and development of communities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Questions asked:</strong> How do predators affect the diversity of prey species in this forest? What are the patterns of energy flow in this lake? How does succession proceed after a volcanic eruption?</li>
