        <h2 id="topic1">Types of gardening</h2>
        <p>This topic expands on the "garden types" from Unit 1, focusing on their specific functions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Landscape gardening:</strong> The art and science of designing and creating large, aesthetically pleasing outdoor spaces (e.g., for corporate campuses, resorts, public areas). It involves "hardscape" (paths, walls) and "softscape" (plants, lawns).</li>
            <li><strong>Home gardening:</strong> Small-scale, private gardening at a residence, primarily for pleasure and aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li><strong>Kitchen Garden:</strong> A utilitarian garden focused on producing fresh vegetables, fruits, and herbs for domestic consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Orchards:</strong> A form of commercial gardening focused on the large-scale cultivation of fruit trees (e.g., mango orchards, apple orchards).</li>
            <li><strong>Terrace gardening:</strong> A specialized form of urban gardening where plants are grown in containers, grow bags, or raised beds on rooftops, balconies, and terraces. This is crucial for cities with limited ground space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">Concept of Public Parks and Botanical Gardens</h2>
        
        <h3>Public Parks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept:</strong> A large area of green space within a city or town, owned and managed by the government (municipality), and open to the public for <strong>recreation, leisure, and exercise</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Large lawns, flower beds, playgrounds, walking/jogging tracks, seating areas, and sometimes water bodies.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> To improve the quality of life, health, and well-being of the citizens.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Botanical Gardens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept:</strong> A "living museum" of plants. It is a large, scientifically managed garden with a documented collection of plants from various parts of the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Plants are labeled with their botanical name, family, and origin. Often includes specialized sections (e.g., medicinal garden, cactus house, orchid house) and a <strong>herbarium</strong> (a library of dried plant specimens).</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Goals:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> *Ex-situ* conservation of rare and endangered plant species.</li>
                    <li><strong>Research:</strong> Scientific study of plant taxonomy, genetics, and economic botany.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> To educate the public and students about plant diversity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recreation:</strong> They also serve a recreational purpose, but their core mission is scientific.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">Selection of Plant materials and designing of gardens</h2>
        
        <h3>Selection of Plant Materials</h3>
        <p>Choosing the "right plant for the right place" is the most important rule in gardening. Factors to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Select plants that are adapted to your local climate (temperature, rainfall, humidity). Using native plants is often the best choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Observe your garden. Is it full sun (6+ hours), part shade (3-6 hours), or full shade (less than 3 hours)? Select plants that match the light conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Is your soil sandy (drains fast), clay (heavy, drains slow), or loamy (ideal)? Choose plants that tolerate your soil, or amend the soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What do you want the plant for?
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focal Point:</strong> A single, spectacular specimen tree or shrub.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hedge/Screen:</strong> A row of dense, fast-growing shrubs for privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ground Cover:</strong> Low-growing, spreading plants to cover soil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal Color:</strong> Annual flowers for bright, temporary color.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Be realistic. Choose low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants if you have limited time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Designing of Gardens</h3>
        <p>This involves arranging the plants and adornments according to a chosen style (formal or informal) to create a unified and pleasing space.</p>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: A simple bubble diagram showing the layout of a formal garden vs. an informal garden]</strong>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Key Principles:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unity:</strong> The garden should feel like a single, cohesive space. This is achieved by repeating elements (e.g., a specific plant, a color, a type of stone).</li>
            <li id="spap_1"><strong>Balance:</strong> The visual weight of the garden should be balanced.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symmetrical (Formal):</strong> One side is a mirror image of the other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asymmetrical (Informal):</strong> Different elements are used on each side, but they have equal "visual weight."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Focal Point:</strong> A dominant feature (e.g., a statue, a fountain, a large tree) that draws the eye and anchors the design.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhythm & Flow:</strong> Using curved paths or repeating plants to guide the eye through the garden.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Keeping the size of plants and structures in proportion to the house and the overall garden size.</li>
            <li><strong>Planting in Layers:</strong> Placing tall plants (trees, large shrubs) at the back, medium plants (shrubs, perennials) in the middle, and low plants (annuals, ground cover) at the front.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic4">Bookkeeping, marketing and management practices</h2>
        <p>This section applies to running a <strong>commercial nursery</strong> as a business.</p>
        
        <h3>Bookkeeping</h3>
        <p>The systematic recording of all financial transactions of the nursery. This is essential for tracking profitability, managing cash flow, and for tax purposes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Records:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expense Ledger:</strong> Tracking all costs (e.g., pots, soil, seeds, labor, electricity, rent).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sales Ledger:</strong> Tracking all income from plant sales (wholesale and retail).</li>
                    <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> A count of all plants (stock) in the nursery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement:</strong> A summary (e.g., monthly or yearly) that shows Total Income - Total Expenses = Net Profit/Loss.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>The activities a nursery undertakes to promote and sell its products (plants).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Who are you selling to? (e.g., general public, landscape contractors, other nurseries).</li>
            <li><strong>Branding:</strong> Creating a unique name, logo, and reputation for quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Setting prices based on the cost to grow the plant and its market value.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Offline:</strong> Good signage, display boards, local newspaper ads, participating in garden shows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online:</strong> Having a website, using social media (Instagram, Facebook) to show plant photos, creating an e-commerce store.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Management Practices</h3>
        <p>The overall running of the nursery, including operations, finance, and human resources.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Knowing how many plants of each species you have, and propagating new plants *before* you run out (forecasting).</li>
            <li><strong>Operations Management:</strong> Scheduling routine tasks (watering, fertilizing, pest control, potting) efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Providing helpful, knowledgeable advice to customers to build loyalty.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensuring the nursery follows all government regulations (e.g., business license, water use, pesticide use).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic5">Nursery Operations (Soil, Sowing, Management)</h2>
        <p>These are the day-to-day horticultural tasks in a nursery.</p>
        
        <h3>Soil laying (Potting Mix)</h3>
        <p>Nursery plants are rarely grown in pure garden soil. They are grown in a custom <strong>potting mix</strong> (or "substrate"). An ideal mix is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight</li>
            <li>Well-draining (prevents root rot)</li>
            <li>Able to retain moisture and nutrients</li>
            <li>Sterile (free of weeds and diseases)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Common Ingredients:</strong> Soil + Compost/Manure + <strong>Coco Peat</strong> (for moisture) + <strong>Perlite/Vermiculite</strong> (for aeration).</p>
        
        <h3>Manuring</h3>
        <p>Supplying nutrients. This is critical in pots, as nutrients wash out. Can be done by:
        <ul>
            <li>Mixing <strong>slow-release fertilizer</strong> or compost into the potting mix.</li>
            <li>Applying a <strong>liquid fertilizer</strong> (e.g., NPK 19:19:19) during watering every 2-3 weeks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Watering</h3>
        <p>The most critical and difficult task. Overwatering is the #1 killer of nursery plants.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rule:</strong> Water only when the top 1-2 inches of soil is dry. Water deeply until it runs out the drainage hole.</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Drip irrigation or hand watering is preferred over overhead sprinklers (which can spread disease).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Sowing of samplings (Seedlings)</h3>
        <p>"Samplings" likely refers to seedlings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sowing:</strong> Seeds are sown in shallow <strong>seedling trays</strong> with a fine, sterile "seed starting mix."</li>
            <li><strong>Pricking Out:</strong> Once the seedlings have their first "true leaves," they are gently separated and "pricked out" (transplanted) into individual small pots or "polybags" to grow larger.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Management and control of weeds and pests</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weeds:</strong> Weeds must be meticulously removed from pots by hand, as they compete directly with the plant.</li>
            <li><strong>Pests:</strong> Common pests (mealybugs, aphids, spider mites) are controlled by:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Spraying with a jet of water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biological:</strong> Using neem oil spray.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical:</strong> Using appropriate insecticides (as a last resort).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Harvesting operation</h3>
        <p>This refers to preparing the plants for sale.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plants are checked to ensure they are healthy, pest-free, and well-rooted.</li>
            <li>They are cleaned, watered, and often given a fresh top-dressing of compost.</li>
            <li>Plants are labeled with their name, price, and care instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="topic6">Storage and Marketing strategies</h2>
        
        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>Live plants cannot be "stored" for long, but they must be "held" in good condition until sold.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Plants with similar needs (e.g., "shade-loving," "sun-loving," "high-water") are grouped together to make care efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardening Off:</strong> Plants moved from a protected greenhouse into the open sunlight must be "hardened off" – gradually acclimatized to the harsh conditions over 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Providing temporary shade or frost protection as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Marketing Strategies</h3>
        <p>This expands on the "Marketing" topic above, focusing on strategy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Niche Marketing:</strong> Specializing in a specific plant group (e.g., "only indoor plants," "only fruit trees," "only rare succulents") to become a go-to expert.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Sales:</strong> Promoting plants based on the season (e.g., "Buy your winter flower seedlings now!" or "Mango saplings for the monsoon").</li>
            <li><strong>Value Addition:</strong> Not just selling plants.
                <ul>
                    <li>Selling "combo" packs (e.g., pot + plant + soil).</li>
                    <li>Creating planted arrangements and terrariums.</li>
                    <li>Providing services like garden design, planting, and maintenance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Hosting workshops (e.g., "How to make a terrarium," "Bonsai for beginners") to attract customers, build community, and establish authority.</li>
        </ul>
