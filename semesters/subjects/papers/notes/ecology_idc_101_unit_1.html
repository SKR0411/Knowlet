            <h2>1. Definition, Scope, and Importance</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition: Ecology</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Ecology</strong> is the scientific study of the interactions and relationships between living organisms (biotic) and their non-living (abiotic) environment.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>The term was coined by German biologist <strong>Ernst Haeckel</strong> in 1866.</li>
                <li>It comes from the Greek words <em>Oikos</em> (meaning 'house' or 'dwelling') and <em>Logos</em> (meaning 'study'). It is literally "the study of the household of nature."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Definition: Environmental Science</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Environmental Science</strong> is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates physical, biological, and information sciences (including ecology, geology, chemistry, physics, etc.) to study the environment and find solutions to environmental problems.
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Ecology is a specific biological science that is a *component* of environmental science. Environmental science is a *broader, interdisciplinary* field that includes ecology but also adds social sciences (like law, ethics, economics) and physical sciences (like chemistry, geology) to address human impacts on the environment.</p>

            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>The scope of these fields is vast, ranging from the micro-level to the global scale:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organism Level:</strong> How an individual (like a fish) adapts to its water temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Population Level:</strong> Studying the factors that control the size of a deer population.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Level:</strong> How different species (predators, prey, competitors) interact in a forest.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Level:</strong> Studying the flow of energy and nutrients in a lake.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Level:</strong> Understanding global warming, ozone depletion, and global biogeochemical cycles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Importance</h3>
            <p>Understanding ecology and environmental science is crucial for human survival and well-being:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Conservation of Biodiversity:</strong> It helps us understand how to protect endangered species and maintain genetic diversity.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> It provides the scientific basis for managing our resources sustainably (e.g., fisheries, forests, fresh water).</li>
                <li><strong>Solving Environmental Problems:</strong> It is essential for tackling problems like pollution, climate change, and deforestation.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Health:</strong> It helps us understand the links between environmental quality (clean air, clean water) and public health.</li>
                <li><strong>Predicting Impact:</strong> It allows us to predict the ecological consequences of human actions (e.g., building a dam, introducing a new species).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>2. History of Ecology</h2>
            <p>While the term "ecology" is relatively new, its roots are ancient. Humans have always been "ecologists" in a practical sense, needing to understand the distribution of plants, animals, and water for survival.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Historical Milestones:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ancient Roots:</strong> Early Greek scholars like <strong>Aristotle</strong> and <strong>Theophrastus</strong> made observations on the relationships between animals and their environments.</li>
                <li><strong>18th-19th Century Naturalists:</strong> Explorers and naturalists like <strong>Alexander von Humboldt</strong> documented how climate and geography shape vegetation (biogeography), laying the groundwork for ecology.</li>
                <li><strong>Charles Darwin (1859):</strong> His theory of evolution by natural selection provided a powerful mechanism for *why* organisms are adapted to their environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Ernst Haeckel (1866):</strong> Coined the term "Ecology."</li>
                <li><strong>Early 20th Century:</strong> Ecology became a formal, quantitative science. Scholars like <strong>Eugenius Warming</strong> (plant ecology), <strong>Arthur Tansley</strong> (coined the term "ecosystem" in 1935), and <strong>Charles Elton</strong> (food chains, niches) developed its core concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-20th Century (The Environmental Movement):</strong> <strong>Rachel Carson's</strong> book <em>Silent Spring</em> (1962) was a landmark event. It exposed the dangers of pesticides (like DDT) and brought ecological concerns to the public, launching the modern environmental movement.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="approaches">
            <h2>3. Various Approaches of Studying Ecology and Environmental Science</h2>
            <p>Scientists study ecology using several different approaches, often in combination:</p>
            
            <h3>Based on Methodology:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Field Studies (Observational):</strong> Involves observing and measuring organisms and environmental factors in their natural setting. (e.g., counting a bird population, measuring water quality in a river).</li>
                <li><strong>Field Experiments (Manipulative):</strong> Involves actively manipulating a factor in the field to see its effect. (e.g., removing a predator from one area to see what happens to the prey population, compared to an untouched "control" area).</li>
                <li><strong>Laboratory Experiments:</strong> Conducted in a controlled setting. This allows scientists to isolate a single variable. (e.g., growing plants at different temperature levels in a lab to find their optimal temperature).</li>
                <li><strong>Modeling (Theoretical):</strong> Using mathematical equations and computer simulations to model complex systems, like population growth or global climate change, and make predictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Based on Level of Organization (Branches of Ecology):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autecology (Species Ecology):</strong> Focuses on the study of a <em>single species</em> and its relationship with its environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Synecology (Community Ecology):</strong> Focuses on the study of <em>groups of organisms</em> (communities) and their interactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="multidisciplinary">
            <h2>4. Multidisciplinary Nature of Ecology and Environmental Science</h2>
            <p>Environmental Science, in particular, is not a single subject. It is an <strong>interdisciplinary field</strong> that draws upon many other branches of knowledge to understand and solve complex problems.</p>
            <p>A single environmental issue, like <strong>acid rain</strong>, requires a multidisciplinary approach:</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A central circle labeled "Environmental Science." Arrows point to it from many other fields:
                <br>- <strong>Biology/Ecology:</strong> How does acid rain affect fish and forests?
                <br>- <strong>Chemistry:</strong> How do SO₂ and NOₓ react in the atmosphere to form acid?
                <br>- <strong>Geology:</strong> How does acid rain affect the weathering of rock and soil?
                <br>- <strong>Meteorology:</strong> How are the pollutants transported by wind?
                <br>- <strong>Engineering:</strong> How can we design "scrubbers" to remove pollutants from smokestacks?
                <br>- <strong>Economics:</strong> What is the cost-benefit analysis of installing scrubbers?
                <br>- <strong>Law & Politics:</strong> How do we create laws (like the Clean Air Act) to regulate emissions?
                <br>- <strong>Ethics:</strong> What is our moral responsibility to future generations and other species?
            </div>
            <p>No single discipline can solve this problem alone. Ecology provides the core understanding of the damage, but Environmental Science brings all the fields together for a solution.</p>

            <h2>5. Human Ecology and its Scope</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition: Human Ecology</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Human Ecology</strong> is a branch of ecology that studies the interactions between <strong>human social systems</strong> and their <strong>environment</strong>. It applies ecological concepts (like population, community, adaptation) to human societies.
            </blockquote>
            <p>It essentially asks: How do humans adapt to, use, and change their environment, and how do these environmental changes in turn affect human societies, culture, and health?</p>

            <h3>Scope of Human Ecology</h3>
            <p>The scope is very broad and includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Population Dynamics:</strong> Studying human population growth, density (urbanization), and migration patterns in response to environmental resources or pressures.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> How human culture and technology are forms of adaptation to the environment (e.g., building igloos in the Arctic, developing irrigation in the desert).</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Use:</strong> Analyzing how different societies (e.g., hunter-gatherer, agricultural, industrial) extract, consume, and manage natural resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Impact:</strong> Investigating the "ecological footprint" of human activities, such as urbanization, industrial pollution, and modern agriculture.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Justice:</strong> A key area that studies how the negative impacts of environmental problems (like pollution) are often unequally distributed, disproportionately affecting poor and minority communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Main Idea:</strong> Human Ecology emphasizes that humans are <strong>not separate from</strong> nature, but are an integral, and often dominant, part of ecosystems.
