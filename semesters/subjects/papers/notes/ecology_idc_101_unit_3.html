            <h2>1. Definition, Composition, and Importance</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition: Atmosphere</h3>
            <blockquote>
                The <strong>Atmosphere</strong> is the thin envelope of gases that surrounds the Earth, held in place by gravity.
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>The atmosphere is a mixture of gases. The composition of dry air is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen (N₂):</strong> 78.08% (largely inert)</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen (O₂):</strong> 20.95% (essential for respiration)</li>
                <li><strong>Argon (Ar):</strong> 0.93% (inert noble gas)</li>
                <li><strong>Trace Gases:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):</strong> ~0.04% (essential for photosynthesis; a major greenhouse gas)</li>
                        <li>Neon (Ne), Helium (He), Methane (CH₄), Krypton (Kr), Hydrogen (H₂)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Variable Component:</strong> <strong>Water Vapor (H₂O)</strong>, which can range from 0% to 4% and is responsible for clouds and weather.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Importance of Atmosphere</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Provides Gases for Life:</strong> It contains the oxygen (O₂) we breathe and the carbon dioxide (CO₂) plants use for photosynthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Filters Harmful Radiation:</strong> The <strong>ozone layer</strong> in the stratosphere blocks most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV-B and UV-C) radiation.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulates Temperature (Greenhouse Effect):</strong> It traps heat from the sun, keeping the planet warm enough for life to exist. Without it, Earth's average temperature would be about -18°C.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather and Water Cycle:</strong> It is the medium for the hydrological (water) cycle, creating weather, clouds, and rain.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection from Meteors:</strong> It acts as a shield, burning up most meteoroids before they can strike the surface.</li>

            <h2>3. Stratospheric Ozone (The "Good" Ozone)</h2>
            <p><strong>Ozone (O₃)</strong> is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms. It's important to know there are two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tropospheric Ozone (Bad Ozone):</strong> Found at ground level, it is a major component of smog and is a toxic air pollutant that damages lungs and plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Stratospheric Ozone (Good Ozone):</strong> Found in the stratosphere (the "ozone layer"), it is essential for life on Earth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>Ozone Layer</strong> is a region in the stratosphere (approx. 15-30 km high) with a relatively high concentration of ozone. Its job is to act as a global sunscreen, absorbing 97-99% of the sun's harmful <strong>ultraviolet (UV) radiation</strong>, especially UV-B and UV-C, preventing it from reaching the surface.</p>

            <h2>4. Depletion of Ozone Layer and Ozone Hole</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem: Depletion</h3>
            <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, scientists discovered that the ozone layer was thinning globally, with a severe seasonal depletion over Antarctica, known as the <strong>"Ozone Hole."</strong></p>

            <h3>The Cause: CFCs</h3>
            <p>The primary culprits were a class of chemicals called <strong>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</strong>. These were widely used as refrigerants (e.g., in air conditioners, refrigerators), in aerosol spray cans, and as industrial solvents.</p>
            
            <h3>The Chemical Process:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>CFCs are very stable, so they are not destroyed in the troposphere. They slowly rise to the stratosphere.</li>
                <li>In the stratosphere, high-energy UV radiation breaks the CFC molecule apart, releasing a <strong>chlorine (Cl) atom</strong>.</li>
                <li>This chlorine atom acts as a catalyst, starting a destructive chain reaction.
                    <br><strong>Cl + O₃ → ClO + O₂</strong> (Chlorine destroys an ozone molecule)
                    <br><strong>ClO + O → Cl + O₂</strong> (The chlorine atom is regenerated, free to destroy another ozone)
                </li>
                <li>A single chlorine atom can destroy <strong>up to 100,000 ozone molecules</strong> before it is finally removed from the atmosphere.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Consequences of Depletion:</h3>
            <p>With less ozone, more UV-B radiation reaches the surface, causing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In Humans:</strong> Increased rates of skin cancer, cataracts, and weakened immune systems.</li>
                <li><strong>In Ecosystems:</strong> Damage to plants (reducing photosynthesis and crop yields) and harm to plankton, the base of the marine food web.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Solution: The Montreal Protocol (1987)</h3>
            <p>In a major international success story, the world's nations signed the <strong>Montreal Protocol</strong>, an agreement to phase out the production and use of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. This protocol has been highly effective, and the ozone layer is now slowly beginning to recover.</p>

            <h2>5. Global Warming and Climate Change</h2>
            
            <h3>The Greenhouse Effect (Natural vs. Enhanced)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Greenhouse Effect:</strong> This is a good, natural process. Greenhouse gases (like H₂O, CO₂, CH₄) in the atmosphere trap some of the outgoing heat from Earth, keeping the planet warm.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Greenhouse Effect (Global Warming):</strong> Human activities, primarily the <strong>burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)</strong>, deforestation, and agriculture, have released unprecedented amounts of greenhouse gases, especially <strong>CO₂</strong>, into the atmosphere. This "thickens the blanket," trapping *too much* heat and causing the planet's average temperature to rise.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Global Warming vs. Climate Change</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Refers to the long-term <em>increase in Earth's average surface temperature</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> A broader term that refers to all the <em>long-term changes in climate patterns</em> caused by global warming.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Consequences of Climate Change:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> From melting glaciers and polar ice caps, and thermal expansion (warm water takes up more space).</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme Weather:</strong> More frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall (floods), and stronger hurricanes.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Disruption:</strong> Species migrating to cooler areas, coral bleaching, and high extinction risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Impacts on Agriculture:</strong> Shifting growing seasons and crop failures due to drought or floods.</li>

            <h2>6. Acid Rain</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p><strong>Acid rain</strong> is any form of precipitation (rain, snow, fog, or dry particles) that is unusually acidic, meaning it has a pH lower than normal rain (which is ~5.6). Acid rain can have a pH of 4.2 or even lower.</p>

            <h3>The Cause</h3>
            <p>The main cause is the burning of fossil fuels, especially <strong>coal</strong> (for electricity) and <strong>oil</strong> (in vehicles).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Burning these fuels releases <strong>Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)</strong> and <strong>Nitrogen Oxides (NOₓ)</strong> into the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>These gases react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the atmosphere to form <strong>Sulphuric Acid (H₂SO₄)</strong> and <strong>Nitric Acid (HNO₃)</strong>.</li>
                <li>These strong acids dissolve in water droplets and fall to the Earth as acid rain.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Consequences of Acid Rain:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On Aquatic Ecosystems:</strong> Makes lakes and rivers acidic, killing fish, amphibians, and other aquatic life.</li>
                <li><strong>On Forests:</strong> Damages leaves, leaches essential nutrients (like calcium) from the soil, and releases toxic aluminum, weakening and killing trees.</li>
                <li><strong>On Buildings:</strong> Corrodes and dissolves limestone, marble (statues, monuments), and metal.</li>
