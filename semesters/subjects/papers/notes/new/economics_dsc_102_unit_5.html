        <h2 id="topic1">Balance of Payments</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>Balance of Payments (BOP)</strong> is a systematic statement that records <strong>all economic transactions</strong> (involving goods, services, income, and assets) between the <strong>residents of one country</strong> and the <strong>rest of the world</strong> during a specific period (usually one year).
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Double-Entry Bookkeeping:</strong> Every transaction is recorded twiceâ€”once as a <strong>Credit (+)</strong> and once as a <strong>Debit (-)</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Credit (+):</strong> Any transaction that leads to an *inflow* of foreign currency. (e.g., Exports, Foreign Investment in our country).</li>
                    <li><strong>Debit (-):</strong> Any transaction that leads to an *outflow* of foreign currency. (e.g., Imports, Our investment abroad).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In theory, the BOP always "balances":</strong> Total Credits = Total Debits. A "deficit" or "surplus" refers to a specific *part* of the BOP.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic2">Current and Capital Account</h2>
        <p>The BOP is broadly divided into two main accounts:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Current Account</h3>
        <p>This account records transactions related to the <strong>current flow of goods, services, and income</strong>. It includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Trade in Goods (Visible Trade):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exports of physical goods (+)</li>
                    <li>Imports of physical goods (-)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trade in Services (Invisible Trade):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exports of services (+) (e.g., tourism, software services, shipping)</li>
                    <li>Imports of services (-) (e.g., Indians travelling abroad)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Net Income:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Factor income *from* abroad (+) (e.g., profits, interest, wages earned by residents abroad)</li>
                    <li>Factor income *paid* to abroad (-) (e.g., profits, interest paid to foreign investors)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Net Unilateral Transfers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>One-way transfers received (+) (e.g., foreign aid, remittances from abroad)</li>
                    <li>Transfers paid (-) (e.g., donations to other countries)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>2. Capital Account</h3>
        <p>This account records transactions that involve the <strong>purchase or sale of assets</strong> (both real and financial). It represents changes in the country's foreign assets and liabilities.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Foreign Investment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):</strong> Long-term investment involving control (e.g., a foreign company building a factory in India (+)).</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):</strong> Short-term, financial investment (e.g., a foreign fund buying Indian stocks (+)).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Loans:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>External Commercial Borrowing (+)</li>
                    <li>Repayment of loans (-)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Changes in Official Reserves:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the "balancing" item. It is the account of the central bank (e.g., RBI).</li>
                    <li>If there is a BOP deficit, the RBI must *sell* foreign currency (e.g., $). This sale is a *credit* (+) entry, which makes the BOP balance to zero.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Balance of Trade</h2>
        <blockquote>
            The <strong>Balance of Trade (BOT)</strong> refers *only* to the balance of <strong>visible trade</strong> (i.e., the export and import of <strong>physical goods</strong>).
        </blockquote>
        <span class="formula">
            BOT = Value of Goods Exports - Value of Goods Imports
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BOT Surplus (or Trade Surplus):</strong> Goods Exports > Goods Imports.</li>
            <li><strong>BOT Deficit (or Trade Deficit):</strong> Goods Imports > Goods Exports.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip: BOT vs. BOP Current Account</strong>
            <br>The <strong>Balance of Trade</strong> is just *one component* of the <strong>Current Account</strong>. A country can have a <strong>BOT deficit</strong> (imports more goods than it exports) but still have a <strong>Current Account surplus</strong> if its "invisible" earnings from services and income are very high.
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic4">Disequilibrium in BOP</h2>
        <p>A <strong>BOP Disequilibrium</strong> refers to a persistent <strong>surplus</strong> or <strong>deficit</strong> in the "autonomous" parts of the BOP (i.e., the Current Account and Capital Account *combined*).</p>
        <p>It is "settled" by the movement of the central bank's Official Reserves.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BOP Deficit:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Autonomous *outflows* (Debits) are <em>greater than</em> autonomous *inflows* (Credits).</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The central bank must *sell* foreign currency (e.g., $) from its reserves to finance the deficit. The country's official reserves <em>decrease</em>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>BOP Surplus:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Autonomous *inflows* (Credits) are <em>greater than</em> autonomous *outflows* (Debits).</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The central bank *buys* the excess foreign currency. The country's official reserves <em>increase</em>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic5">Methods of correction of BOP</h2>
        <p>If a country has a persistent BOP <em>deficit</em>, it must take corrective action. The main methods are:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Expenditure-Switching Policies</h3>
        <p>These policies aim to *switch* domestic and foreign spending away from foreign goods and towards domestic goods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Devaluation (under fixed) or Depreciation (under floating):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Making the home currency cheaper (e.g., moving from $1=â‚¹80 to $1=â‚¹85).</li>
                    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Makes <strong>exports cheaper</strong> for foreigners (boosting X) and makes <strong>imports more expensive</strong> for residents (reducing M). This improves the Current Account.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trade Barriers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> A tax on imported goods, making them more expensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quotas:</strong> A physical limit on the quantity of imported goods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Expenditure-Reducing Policies</h3>
        <p>These policies aim to *reduce* overall aggregate demand (and income) in the economy, which in turn reduces the demand for imports.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contractionary Monetary Policy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Central bank raises interest rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Slows down investment (I) and consumption (C), reducing overall income (Y). A fall in Y leads to a fall in imports (M).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contractionary Fiscal Policy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Government cuts its spending (G) or raises taxes (T).</li>
                    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Reduces aggregate demand, lowers income (Y), and thus reduces import spending (M).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Exchange Controls</h3>
        <p>The government directly rations or limits the amount of foreign currency available to the public for imports or travel.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic6">Exchange Rate and Determination of Equilibrium Exchange Rate</h2>
        
        <h3>What is an Exchange Rate?</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Exchange Rate (e)</strong> is the price of one country's currency in terms of another.
        <br><em>Example:</em> $1 = â‚¹83 (This is the price of a dollar in terms of rupees).</p>
        
        <h3>Determination of Equilibrium (under a Floating System)</h3>
        <p>The equilibrium exchange rate is determined by the market forces of <strong>demand</strong> and <strong>supply</strong> in the <strong>foreign exchange market</strong> (e.g., the market for US Dollars).</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demand for Dollars:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who:</strong> By Indians who need dollars to pay for foreign things.</li>
                    <li><strong>Source:</strong> Indian importers, Indians travelling abroad, Indians investing in the US.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curve:</strong> <strong>Downward-sloping</strong>. If the exchange rate is low (e.g., $1=â‚¹70), dollars are cheap, so Indians will demand more of them to buy more US goods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Supply of Dollars:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who:</strong> By foreigners who need rupees to pay for Indian things.</li>
                    <li><strong>Source:</strong> Indian exporters (who earn $), foreign tourists in India, foreign investors in India.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curve:</strong> <strong>Upward-sloping</strong>. If the exchange rate is high (e.g., $1=â‚¹90), foreigners get more rupees for their dollars, so they are incentivized to buy more Indian goods, thus supplying more dollars.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Equilibrium (e*):</strong> Occurs where the Demand curve for dollars intersects the Supply curve for dollars. At this rate, the quantity of dollars demanded equals the quantity supplied.</p>
