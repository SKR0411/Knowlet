            <h2>1. Definition of Archaeology, Aims and Scope</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition of Archaeology</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Archaeology</strong> (from Greek: <em>'arkhaios'</em> meaning 'ancient' and <em>'logos'</em> meaning 'study') is the scientific study of the human past and cultural development through the recovery, documentation, and analysis of <strong>material remains</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>These material remains include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> Portable objects made, modified, or used by humans (e.g., pottery, tools, jewelry, weapons).</li>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Non-portable human-made elements of a site (e.g., hearths, post-holes, walls, pits).</li>
                <li><strong>Structures:</strong> Non-portable constructions (e.g., houses, temples, tombs).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecofacts (or Biofacts):</strong> Organic and environmental remains that show human activity (e.g., animal bones, plant seeds, charcoal).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unlike history, which primarily relies on written texts, archaeology studies all societies, including those that existed before the invention of writing (prehistoric societies).</p>

            <h3>Aims of Archaeology</h3>
            <p>The primary goals or aims of archaeology are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reconstruction of Culture History:</strong> To outline the "what, where, and when" of past events. This involves identifying, describing, and classifying artifacts and sites to build a chronological sequence of cultures in a specific region.</li>
                <li><strong>Reconstruction of Past Lifeways:</strong> To understand "how" people lived. This goes beyond just dates and tools to reconstruct aspects of daily life, diet (subsistence), technology, social organization, trade, and settlement patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Cultural Processes:</strong> To explain "why" cultures changed or stayed the same. This is the most complex aim, seeking to understand the processes of social and cultural evolution, such as the origins of agriculture, the rise of cities, or the collapse of civilizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Preservation and Management:</strong> To conserve and protect the non-renewable archaeological record (cultural heritage) for future generations.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Scope of Archaeology</h3>
            <p>The scope of archaeology is vast, covering the entire span of human history, from the earliest stone tools (c. 3.3 million years ago) to recent historical sites.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temporal Scope:</strong> It covers both <strong>Prehistory</strong> (the period before written records) and <strong>History</strong> (the period after writing was invented).</li>
                <li><strong>Geographical Scope:</strong> It is a global discipline, studying human societies in every continent and environment, from mountains to deserts, and even underwater.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Scope:</strong> Archaeology is not an isolated subject. It borrows heavily from and contributes to many other fields, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Humanities:</strong> History, Art History, Classics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Sciences:</strong> Anthropology, Sociology, Geography.</li>
                        <li><strong>Natural Sciences:</strong> Geology, Chemistry (for dating), Biology (Zooarchaeology, Palaeobotany), Physics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be sure to differentiate between Aims (the *goals* of the study, like "why we do it") and Scope (the *range* of the study, like "what it covers"). A common question is to "Define archaeology and discuss its aims and scope."

            <h2>2. Relationship of Archaeology with History</h2>
            <p>Archaeology and History are both disciplines dedicated to understanding the human past. However, their sources and methods differ significantly.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Differences</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Aspect</th>
                        <th>History</th>
                        <th>Archaeology</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Primary Source</strong></td>
                        <td><strong>Written Records:</strong> Texts, documents, inscriptions, manuscripts, letters.</td>
                        <td><strong>Material Remains:</strong> Artifacts, structures, ecofacts, features.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Time Coverage</strong></td>
                        <td>Limited to the <strong>Historic</strong> period (c. 5,000 years ago to present), when writing existed.</td>
                        <td>Covers the entire human past, including <strong>Prehistory</strong> (99% of human existence).</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Focus</strong></td>
                        <td>Often focuses on specific events, individuals, politics, and ideas (the "elite" perspective).</td>
                        <td>Often focuses on long-term trends, daily life, technology, and the lives of ordinary people.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>How They Complement Each Other</h3>
            <p>Archaeology is not just a "handmaiden to history"; it is an independent discipline that works *with* history to create a more complete picture of the past.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>For Prehistory:</strong> Archaeology is the *only* source of information. Without it, we would know nothing about the vast period before writing.</li>
                <li><strong>For History:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>It fills the gaps:</strong> Written records are often biased, incomplete, or lost. Archaeology provides data on aspects of life that texts ignore (e.g., diet, sanitation, technology of the common people).</li>
                        <li><strong>It confirms or contradicts texts:</strong> Archaeology can test the validity of historical claims. For example, excavating a battlefield can confirm or deny a historian's account of the event.</li>
                        <li><strong>It provides context:</strong> Finding Roman coins in India (e.g., at Arikamedu) provides physical, dateable evidence for the trade routes that were only described in texts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Archaeology studies the *material culture* of the past, while History studies the *textual record* of the past. When studied together (as in <strong>Historical Archaeology</strong>), they provide a much richer and more accurate understanding than either could alone.

            <h2>3. Brief overview of different types of Archaeology</h2>
            <p>Archaeology is a broad field with many specializations. Here are some of the major types:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prehistoric Archaeology:</strong> The study of human societies *before* the advent of written records. This is the largest branch of archaeology.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Archaeology:</strong> The study of societies *after* the development of writing. It uses both material remains and textual sources. (e.g., Mughal-era sites, Colonial American sites).</li>
                <li><strong>Ethno-archaeology:</strong> The study of living (extant) societies to understand how their behaviors form and deposit material remains. This helps archaeologists interpret the patterns they find in the archaeological record. (e.g., studying a modern potter to understand ancient pottery techniques).</li>
                <li><strong>Experimental Archaeology:</strong> The replication of past technologies and processes to test hypotheses about how artifacts were made or used. (e.g., trying to build a pyramid using only tools from that period).</li>
                <li><strong>Underwater (or Maritime) Archaeology:</strong> The study of human interaction with the sea, lakes, and rivers through the analysis of submerged sites, such as shipwrecks, harbors, and submerged settlements.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Archaeology:</strong> The study of the long-term relationship between humans and their environments. It has sub-fields like:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Zooarchaeology:</strong> Study of animal remains from sites (diet, domestication).</li>
                        <li><strong>Palaeobotany (or Archaeo-botany):</strong> Study of plant remains (agriculture, diet, environment).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rescue (or Salvage) Archaeology:</strong> Archaeological excavation conducted in areas threatened by new construction (dams, roads, buildings). It aims to "rescue" data before it is destroyed.</li>
            </ul>
