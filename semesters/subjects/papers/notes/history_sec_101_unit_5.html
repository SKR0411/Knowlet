            <h3>Definition of Museology</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Museology</strong> (or Museum Studies) is the scientific study of museums. It covers the theory, history, and societal role of museums, as well as the principles behind their organization, management, and activities.
            </blockquote>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Museology vs. Museography:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Museology:</strong> The *theory* of museums (Why do museums exist? What is their role? What are the ethics of collecting?).</li>
                    <li><strong>Museography:</strong> The *practice* and application of museology (How to design an exhibit? What lighting to use? How to conserve an object?).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Scope of Museology</h3>
            <p>Museology is a wide-ranging field that covers all functions of a museum. Its scope includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Collection & Acquisition:</strong> The principles and policies for acquiring objects (by purchase, donation, bequest, or fieldwork).</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation & Registration:</strong> The systematic recording of all information about an object (its origin, history, condition). This includes <strong>Accessioning</strong> (assigning a unique number) and <strong>Cataloguing</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Conservation & Preservation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preventive Conservation:</strong> Controlling the environment (light, humidity, temperature) to *prevent* decay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remedial Conservation:</strong> Actively repairing or stabilizing a damaged object.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exhibition & Display:</strong> The methods and techniques for communicating information and telling stories to the public using objects in a gallery.</li>
                <li><strong>Education & Outreach:</strong> The role of the museum as an educational institution, including guided tours, workshops, lectures, and publications.</li>
                <li><strong>Museum Management:</strong> Administration, finance, marketing, and legal ethics.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>History of Museum in India</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ancient/Medieval:</strong> While there were no "public museums," collections existed in royal treasuries (<em>ratna-bhandaras</em>) and temple collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Colonial Period (The Beginning):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1784:</strong> The <strong>Asiatic Society of Bengal</strong> is founded in Calcutta by Sir William Jones.</li>
                        <li><strong>1796:</strong> The Society announces its intention to start a museum.</li>
                        <li><strong>1814:</strong> The <strong>Indian Museum, Kolkata</strong> is formally established, with Dr. Nathaniel Wallich as its first curator. It is the <strong>oldest museum in India</strong> and the entire Asia-Pacific region.</li>
                        <li><strong>19th Century:</strong> The British establish "provincial" museums across India, such as the Madras Museum (1851) and the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay (now Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Post-Independence (Expansion):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1949:</strong> The <strong>National Museum, New Delhi</strong> is established, reflecting the new nation's identity.</li>
                        <li>Growth of various types of museums: State Museums (for state-level heritage), University Museums, and specialized museums (e.g., National Rail Museum).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Types of Museums; Site-Museum; Museum of specific display</h2>

            <h3>Types of Museums</h3>
            <p>Museums can be classified in many ways, but the most common is by the *type of collection* they hold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Archaeology Museums:</strong> Focus on artifacts from the human past (e.g., National Museum).</li>
                <li><strong>Art Museums/Galleries:</strong> Focus on paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts (e.g., National Gallery of Modern Art).</li>
                <li><strong>Natural History Museums:</strong> Focus on the natural world (zoology, botany, geology, fossils).</li>
                <li><strong>Ethnography/Anthropology Museums:</strong> Focus on human cultures and their material objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Science & Technology Museums:</strong> Focus on scientific principles and industrial history (e.g., Birla Industrial & Technological Museum).</li>
                <li><strong>General/Multipurpose Museums:</strong> Cover multiple categories (e.g., Indian Museum, which has art, archaeology, and natural history).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Site-Museum</h3>
            <blockquote>
                A <strong>Site-Museum</strong> is a museum constructed <em>at or near</em> an archaeological site, specifically to house and display the objects excavated from that very site.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary advantage is <strong>preserving context</strong>. Visitors can see the artifacts (like sculptures or tools) and then immediately see the ruins of the buildings or structures where they were found.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples in India:</strong> The ASI maintains a large network of site museums.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sarnath Museum (Uttar Pradesh):</strong> Houses the original Lion Capital of Ashoka.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nalanda Museum (Bihar):</strong> Displays objects found at the Nalanda university ruins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hampi Museum (Karnataka):</strong> Houses sculptures and architectural fragments from the Hampi ruins.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Museum of specific display</h3>
            <p>This category refers to <strong>Specialized Museums</strong> that focus on a very narrow or specific theme, rather than a broad subject like "art" or "history."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples in India:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>National Rail Museum, New Delhi:</strong> Focuses only on the history of railways in India.</li>
                        <li><strong>Calico Museum of Textiles, Ahmedabad:</strong> One of the world's finest museums dedicated only to textiles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shankar's International Dolls Museum, New Delhi:</strong> A museum displaying a collection of dolls from around the world.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
