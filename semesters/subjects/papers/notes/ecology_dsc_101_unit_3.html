        <h2 id="topic1">Community Concept</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Community (Definition):</strong> A community (or biocenosis) is an assemblage of all the <strong>different populations of species</strong> (plants, animals, fungi, microbes) living and interacting in a particular geographic area at a particular time.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Community ecology studies the interactions between these species and how they influence the community's structure and organization.</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Keystone Species</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A keystone species is a species that has a <strong>disproportionately large effect on its environment</strong> relative to its abundance.
        </blockquote>
        <p>They are "engineers" of their community. Their removal can lead to a "trophic cascade" and the collapse or dramatic restructuring of the entire community. The term was coined by <strong>Robert Paine</strong> in 1969.</p>
        <p><strong>Classic Example: The Sea Otter (<em>Enhydra lutris</em>)</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Keystone Species:</strong> Sea Otter.</li>
            <li><strong>Prey:</strong> Sea Urchin.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Producer:</strong> Kelp (a large seaweed).</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> Sea otters eat sea urchins. Sea urchins eat kelp.</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With Otters:</strong> Otters keep the urchin population in check. This allows large, healthy "kelp forests" to grow, which in turn provide a critical habitat for hundreds of other species (fish, crabs, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Without Otters:</strong> Urchin populations explode. They graze down all the kelp, creating "urchin barrens" (empty seabeds). The entire kelp forest ecosystem collapses.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Other Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beaver:</strong> A "ecosystem engineer" that builds dams, creating wetlands that are used by many other species.</li>
            <li><strong>Wolf (in Yellowstone):</strong> Reintroduction of wolves controlled elk populations, which allowed willows and aspens to regrow, which in turn stabilized riverbanks and brought back beavers and songbirds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Ecotone and Edge Effect</h2>
        <p>These concepts were introduced in Unit 1 but are central to community ecology.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ecotone:</strong> The transition zone where two or more different communities meet and integrate (e.g., the boundary between a forest and a grassland).</li>
            <li><strong>Edge Effect:</strong> The tendency for ecotones to have a <strong>greater variety and density of organisms</strong> than either of the adjoining communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why does the Edge Effect happen?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The edge provides habitats and resources from <em>both</em> adjacent communities.</li>
            <li>The unique microclimate and structure of the edge itself may create habitats for "edge specialists" that don't exist in either core community.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The edge of a forest may have light-loving grassland plants, shade-tolerant forest plants, and edge-specialist shrubs. This variety of plants supports a high variety of insects, birds, and mammals.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> While edges often increase diversity, "hard" or artificial edges (like a clear-cut forest next to a highway) can be harmful, increasing exposure to wind, predators, and invasive species.</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">Species Interactions (Positive and Negative)</h2>
        <p>Interactions between species (interspecific) are the "glue" that holds a community together. They can be categorized by their effect (+ for benefit, - for harm, 0 for no effect) on the two species involved.</p>

        <h2 id="topic5">Community Structure</h2>
        <p>Community structure refers to the physical and biological organization of a community. Key components include species diversity and stratification.</p>

        <h3 id="sub5_1">Species Diversity</h3>
        <p>Species diversity is a measurement of the variety of species in a community. It has two components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Species Richness:</strong> The <strong>total number</strong> of different species in the community.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Community A (10 oaks, 10 maples) and Community B (100 oaks, 1 maple) have the <strong>same richness</strong> (2 species).</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Species Evenness (or Relative Abundance):</strong> The <strong>proportion</strong> of individuals that belong to each species. A community is "even" if all species are present in similar numbers.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Community A is <strong>very even</strong>. Community B is <strong>very uneven</strong> (dominated by oaks).</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>High species diversity</strong> (both high richness and high evenness) is generally a sign of a healthy, stable, and resilient ecosystem (like a tropical rainforest). Low diversity is common in harsh environments (like the arctic tundra) or polluted sites.</p>
        <h3 id="sub5_2">Stratification</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Stratification is the <strong>vertical layering</strong> of a community, especially in forests and aquatic ecosystems.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Different layers provide different microhabitats (e.g., different levels of light, temperature, and humidity), which allows more species to coexist by partitioning (dividing) resources.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: Stratification in a Temperate Forest</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Canopy Layer:</strong> The uppermost layer of tall, mature trees (e.g., oaks, maples). Receives full sunlight. Home to eagles, squirrels.</li>
            <li><strong>Understory Layer:</strong> Shorter trees and young trees (e.g., dogwood, saplings). Receives filtered sunlight. Home to many songbirds.</li>
            <li><strong>Shrub Layer:</strong> Woody shrubs (e.g., berries, rhododendrons). Low light. Home to rabbits, deer.</li>
            <li><strong>Herb/Ground Layer:</strong> Non-woody plants, ferns, and mosses on the forest floor. Very low light. Home to insects, mice, salamanders.</li>
            <li><strong>Forest Floor (Litter/Soil):</strong> Decomposing organic matter (leaves, logs). Home to fungi, bacteria, worms, and millipedes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Aquatic Stratification (in a Lake):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Epilimnion:</strong> Top layer, warm, well-lit (photosynthesis).</li>
            <li><strong>Metalimnion (Thermocline):</strong> Middle layer, rapid temperature drop.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypolimnion:</strong> Bottom layer, cold, dark, low oxygen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">Ecological Succession</h2>

        <h3 id="sub6_1">Definition and Types</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Ecological succession is the predictable and orderly process of <strong>change in a community's structure</strong> over time, following a disturbance or the creation of a new habitat.
        </blockquote>
        <p>One set of species colonizes an area, changes the environment, and is then replaced by another set of species better suited to the new conditions.</p>
        <p>There are two main types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Primary Succession:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Starts on:</strong> A brand new, lifeless substrate where no soil exists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> A bare rock exposed by a landslide, a new volcanic island (lava flow), or land exposed by a retreating glacier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Very slow. Starts with <strong>pioneer species</strong> (like lichens and mosses) that can break down rock to create the very first layer of soil. Over centuries, small herbs, then shrubs, and finally trees can establish.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Succession:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Starts on:</strong> An area where a previous community was disturbed or destroyed, but the <strong>soil remains intact</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> An abandoned farm field, a clear-cut forest, or an area after a forest fire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Much faster than primary succession. Pioneer species are usually fast-growing "weeds" and grasses from the existing seed bank in the soil. These are followed by shrubs, then fast-growing "pioneer trees" (like pine), and finally shade-tolerant "hardwood trees" (like oak and hickory).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="sub6_2">Climax Community</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A climax community is the <strong>stable, mature, and self-sustaining</strong> community that is the final stage of ecological succession.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This community is in equilibrium with its environment (especially the climate) and will remain relatively unchanged unless a major disturbance occurs. This traditional view was proposed by <strong>Frederic Clements</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics of a Climax Community:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>High species diversity.</li>
            <li>Complex food webs.</li>
            <li>High biomass.</li>
            <li>Nutrient cycling is efficient and "closed" (nutrients are recycled within the system rather than lost).</li>
            <li>Resistant to small disturbances.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Modern View:</strong> The "climax community" concept is now seen as idealistic. Modern ecologists view communities as being in a state of constant change (a "dynamic equilibrium" or "patchwork mosaic") due to small, frequent disturbances (like tree falls, small fires) that prevent a single, uniform climax state from ever being reached.
