        <h2 id="topic1">1. Concept of Mineral</h2>
        <p>The term "mineral" is precise. To be classified as a mineral, a substance must meet five specific criteria.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition of a Mineral:</strong> A mineral is a...
            <ol>
                <li><span id="spap_1">Naturally Occurring:</span> It must be formed by natural geological processes, not man-made (e.g., synthetic diamond is not a mineral).</li>
                <li><span id="spap_2">Inorganic:</span> It must not be formed from living organisms or their remains (e.g., coal, which comes from plants, is not a mineral).</li>
                <li><span id="spap_3">Solid:</span> It must be a solid substance at standard Earth surface temperatures (e.g., liquid water is not a mineral, but ice is).</li>
                <li><span id="spap_4">Definite Chemical Composition:</span> Its chemical makeup is fixed or varies within a specific, limited range (e.g., Quartz is always SiO‚ÇÇ, Halite is always NaCl).</li>
                <li><span id="spap_5">Ordered Internal Structure:</span> The atoms within it are arranged in a repeating, orderly, three-dimensional pattern. This is what makes it <strong class="key-term">crystalline</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Substances that have a chemical composition but lack an ordered internal structure (like volcanic glass) are called <strong class="key-term">mineraloids</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="common-mistake">
            Confusing minerals and rocks. A <strong class="key-term">rock</strong> is an aggregate (a mixture) of one or more minerals or mineraloids. For example, the rock Granite is composed of the minerals Quartz, Feldspar, and Mica. A mineral is a single, pure "ingredient."
        </div>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            This five-part definition is a classic exam question. Be prepared to list and explain all five criteria.

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Classification: Rock-Forming vs. Ore-Forming Minerals</h2>
        <p>Minerals can be broadly grouped based on their abundance and economic value.</p>
        
        <h3>Rock-Forming Minerals</h3>
        <p>These are the minerals that make up the vast majority (over 90%) of the Earth's crust. They are the common "building blocks" of most rocks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Examples:</strong> The <span id="spap_6">Silicates</span> are the most dominant group.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quartz</strong> (SiO‚ÇÇ)</li>
                    <li><strong>Feldspar Group</strong> (e.g., Orthoclase, Plagioclase)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mica Group</strong> (e.g., Muscovite, Biotite)</li>
                    <li><strong>Amphibole Group</strong> (e.g., Hornblende)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pyroxene Group</strong> (e.g., Augite)</li>
                    <li><strong>Olivine</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other Common Groups:</strong> Carbonates (like Calcite) and Oxides are also important rock-formers in specific environments.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ore-Forming Minerals</h3>
        <p>These are minerals from which a metal or other valuable element can be extracted <strong class="key-term">profitably</strong>. The key distinction is <span id="spap_7">economic viability</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The element of interest is present in high concentration.</li>
            <li>The mineral can be processed relatively easily to extract the element.</li>
            <li>A deposit of this mineral is called an <strong class="key-term">ore deposit</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

            Remember that "ore" is an economic term, not a purely geological one. A mineral like Hematite is *always* Hematite, but it's only considered an "ore mineral" when it's found in a high enough concentration to be mined for profit.

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Physical Properties of Minerals and Their Significance</h2>
        <p>Physical properties are the primary tools used to identify minerals in the field (hand-specimen identification). These properties are a direct expression of the mineral's <span id="spap_8">chemical composition and internal crystalline structure</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>The first thing you notice, but often the <strong class="key-term">least reliable</strong> property.
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="key-term">Idiochromatic:</strong> Minerals that have a consistent, characteristic color (e.g., Malachite is always green, Azurite is always blue).
                <li><strong class="key-term">Allochromatic:</strong> Minerals that come in many colors due to tiny impurities (e.g., Quartz can be clear, white, pink, purple, or black).
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Streak</h3>
        <p>The <span id="spap_9">color of a mineral's powder</span> when scraped against an unglazed porcelain plate (a "streak plate").
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Far more reliable than color. A mineral's color may vary, but its streak is almost always consistent.
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Hematite can be black, gray, or red, but it *always* leaves a cherry-red streak. Pyrite ("Fool's Gold") is gold-colored, but its streak is greenish-black.
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Luster</h3>
        <p>The <span id="spap_10">way a mineral's surface reflects light</span>. This is independent of color.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metallic:</strong> Looks like polished metal (e.g., Galena, Pyrite).
                <li><strong>Non-metallic:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="key-term">Vitreous:</strong> Glassy (e.g., Quartz)
                        <li><strong class="key-term">Pearly:</strong> Iridescent, like a pearl (e.g., Talc, some Micas)
                        <li><strong class="key-term">Resinous:</strong> Looks like resin or tree sap (e.g., Sphalerite)
                        <li><strong class="key-term">Silky:</strong> Has a fibrous sheen (e.g., Gypsum-satin spar)
                        <li><strong class="key-term">Waxy / Greasy:</strong> Looks like it's coated in oil (e.g., Serpentine)

        <h3>Cleavage</h3>
        <p>The tendency of a mineral to <span id="spap_13">break along flat, parallel planes of weakness</span> in its crystal structure.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Described by the number of directions and their angles.
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Perfect (Mica), Good (Feldspar), Poor (Beryl).

        <h3>Specific Gravity (SG)</h3>
        <p>The <span id="spap_15">ratio of a mineral's density to the density of water</span> (i.e., how "heavy" it feels for its size).
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Galena (SG ‚âà 7.5) feels much heavier than Quartz (SG ‚âà 2.65) of the same size. This is a key identifier for metallic ores.
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The test is simple: a harder mineral will scratch a softer one.</p>

        <p>Silicate minerals are the <strong class="key-term">most important and abundant</strong> group of minerals, making up ~95% of the Earth's crust. </p>
        
        <p>Their fundamental building block is the <span id="spap_17"><strong>Silicon-Oxygen Tetrahedron</strong></span> (also called the silica tetrahedron). This structure consists of one small central Silicon atom (Si‚Å¥‚Å∫) bonded to four larger Oxygen atoms (O¬≤‚Åª), forming a pyramid shape.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Formula:</strong> (SiO‚ÇÑ)‚Å¥‚Åª
            <br>
            This basic unit has a net charge of -4, which must be balanced by bonding with positive ions (cations) like Mg¬≤‚Å∫, Fe¬≤‚Å∫, K‚Å∫, etc., or by sharing oxygen atoms with other tetrahedra.

        <p>
            <strong>Iso</strong> = "same", <strong>Morph</strong> = "form"
        </p>
        <p>Isomorphism describes a relationship where two or more different minerals have <span id="spap_18"><strong>different chemical compositions</strong> but the <strong>same crystal structure</strong></span>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> This happens when atoms or ions of similar size and charge can freely substitute for one another in the crystal lattice without changing the overall structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> This often creates an <strong class="key-term">isomorphous series</strong> or <strong class="key-term">solid solution</strong> (see Topic 10).</li>
            <li><strong>Classic Example:</strong> The <span id="spap_19"><strong>Olivine Group</strong></span>: (Mg,Fe)‚ÇÇSiO‚ÇÑ.

                    <li><strong>Forsterite</strong> (Mg‚ÇÇSiO‚ÇÑ) and <strong>Fayalite</strong> (Fe‚ÇÇSiO‚ÇÑ) are the two end-members.</li>
                    <li>The Mg¬≤‚Å∫ and Fe¬≤‚Å∫ ions are very similar in size and have the same charge, so they can substitute for each other in any proportion.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The specific crystal structure that forms depends on the <span id="spap_21"><strong>pressure (P) and temperature (T)</strong></span> conditions during crystallization. Each polymorph is stable in a specific P-T range.
            <li><strong>Classic Example 1: Carbon (C)</strong>

        <p>A pseudomorph is a mineral that has the <span id="spap_22"><strong>outward crystal form (shape) of one mineral</strong>, but is actually composed of a <strong>different mineral</strong></span> that has replaced it. It's a "false form."</p>
        
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Types of Replacement:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alteration:</strong> Only partial replacement (e.g., Anhydrite (CaSO‚ÇÑ) altering to Gypsum (CaSO‚ÇÑ¬∑2H‚ÇÇO) by adding water).
                    <li><strong>Substitution:</strong> Atom-by-atom replacement (e.g., fossilized wood, where silica replaces the wood fibers).
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> <span id="spap_23"><strong>Goethite (FeO(OH)) after Pyrite (FeS‚ÇÇ)</strong></span>. You might find a perfect cube, which is Pyrite's crystal form, but the mineral itself is dull, brown Goethite, not shiny, brassy Pyrite.

        <p>Instead of a fixed formula (like Quartz, SiO‚ÇÇ), minerals in a solid solution series have a variable formula written with parentheses.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conditions for Substitution:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The substituting ions must have similar <strong class="key-term">ionic radii</strong> (size).

                    <li><strong>Albite (Na-rich):</strong> NaAlSi‚ÇÉO‚Çà
                    <li><strong>Anorthite (Ca-rich):</strong> CaAl‚ÇÇSi‚ÇÇO‚Çà
                </ul>
                <p>Here, a coupled substitution of (Na‚Å∫ + Si‚Å¥‚Å∫) is replaced by (Ca¬≤‚Å∫ + Al¬≥‚Å∫). The size is similar, and the total charge (+5) is balanced in both cases.</p>

        <h2 id="topic11">11. Exsolution</h2>
        <p>Exsolution is the <span id="spap_26"><strong>"un-mixing"</strong> of a solid solution</span> that was stable at high temperatures, but becomes unstable as it <strong class="key-term">cools down</strong>. The single mineral separates into two or more distinct mineral phases.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>At high temperature, the crystal lattice is expanded and can accommodate differently-sized ions (forming a solid solution).
                    <li>As the mineral cools, the lattice contracts. The "misfit" ions, which are now too large or too small, are "kicked out" or segregated.
                    <li>These segregated ions form their own tiny, distinct layers or lenses within the host mineral. These are called <strong class="key-term">lamellae</strong>.
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> <span id="spap_27"><strong>Perthite (an Alkali Feldspar)</strong></span>
                <ul>
                    <li>At high-T, K-Feldspar (Orthoclase) and Na-Feldspar (Albite) can form a complete solid solution.
                    <li>As this solution cools, it unmixes.
                    <li>The result (Perthite) is a host crystal of K-Feldspar (Orthoclase) with intergrown lamellae (streaks) of Na-Feldspar (Albite).
                    <li>This un-mixing is what often gives minerals like Moonstone (a variety of feldspar) its beautiful "schiller" or adularescence (play of light).
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            Think of solid solution and exsolution as opposites.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solid Solution:</strong> "Mixing" of ions into one crystal, usually stable at high-T.
                <li><strong>Exsolution:</strong> "Un-mixing" of ions into two phases upon cooling.
