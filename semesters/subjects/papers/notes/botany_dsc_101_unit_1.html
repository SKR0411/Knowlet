        <h2 id="history">1. History of Microbiology</h2>
        
        <h3 id="discovery-microbes">Discovery of Microorganisms (Prokaryotes to Eukaryotes)</h3>
        <p>Microbiology officially began with the invention of the microscope. While the term "microbe" is broad, its discovery was staggered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1670s):</strong> A Dutch cloth merchant, he built high-quality single-lens microscopes. He was the first to observe and meticulously describe single-celled organisms, which he called <strong>"animalcules"</strong> (now known as bacteria and protozoa), from rainwater, dental plaque, and other sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Louis Pasteur (1860s):</strong> Often called the "Father of Microbiology," he disproved the theory of <strong>spontaneous generation</strong> with his famous swan-neck flask experiment. He demonstrated that microbes are present in the air and are responsible for fermentation and spoilage. His work led to the development of pasteurization and vaccines.</li>
            <li><strong>Robert Koch (1870s-80s):</strong> A German physician, he provided the first direct proof of the <strong>Germ Theory of Disease</strong>. He developed techniques to grow microbes in pure culture on solid media (using agar, an idea from Angelina Hesse). He established <strong>Koch's Postulates</strong>, a set of criteria to link a specific microbe to a specific disease.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="discovery-viruses">Discovery of Viruses</h3>
        <p>Viruses were discovered as entities smaller than bacteria that could cause disease.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dmitri Ivanovsky (1892):</strong> A Russian botanist, he studied Tobacco Mosaic Disease (TMD). He found that the sap from an infected plant could transmit the disease even after it was passed through a filter fine enough to trap all bacteria. He called it a "filterable agent."</li>
            <li><strong>Martinus Beijerinck (1898):</strong> He independently replicated Ivanovsky's work and gave this filterable agent a name. He called it <em><strong>contagium vivum fluidum</strong></em> (contagious living fluid) and coined the term <strong>"virus."</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Wendell Stanley (1935):</strong> He crystallized the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), showing it was part particle and part chemical, blurring the line between living and non-living.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="status">2. Status of Microorganisms in the Living World</h2>
        <p>The classification of life, especially microscopic life, has evolved significantly.</p>

        <h3 id="haeckel">Haeckel's System (1866)</h3>
        <p>Ernst Haeckel proposed a three-kingdom system:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Plantae:</strong> Multicellular plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Animalia:</strong> Multicellular animals.</li>
            <li><strong>Protista:</strong> A "catch-all" kingdom for all "simpler" life forms, including bacteria, algae, fungi, and protozoa. This was the first system to formally recognize microorganisms.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="whittaker">Whittaker's Five Kingdom System (1969)</h3>
        <p>Robert Whittaker's system became the standard for decades. It classified organisms based on cell structure (prokaryotic/eukaryotic), cellular organization (unicellular/multicellular), and mode of nutrition.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Monera:</strong> All prokaryotes (bacteria, cyanobacteria). Unicellular.</li>
            <li><strong>Protista:</strong> Unicellular eukaryotes (protozoa, simple algae).</li>
            <li><strong>Fungi:</strong> Eukaryotic, multicellular (mostly), saprotrophic (absorptive nutrition).</li>
            <li><strong>Plantae:</strong> Eukaryotic, multicellular, autotrophic (photosynthetic).</li>
            <li><strong>Animalia:</strong> Eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic (ingestive nutrition).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this system, microorganisms are found in Monera, Protista, and Fungi.</p>

        <h3 id="woese">Carl Woese's Three Domain System (1977)</h3>
        <p>Carl Woese revolutionized classification by using <strong>16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing</strong>. This molecular approach revealed a fundamental split in the prokaryotes.</p>
        <div class="diagram-placeholder"></div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Domain Bacteria:</strong> "True" bacteria. Prokaryotic.</li>
            <li><strong>Domain Archaea:</strong> Prokaryotes that are genetically and biochemically distinct from bacteria (e.g., extremophiles). They are more closely related to Eukarya than to Bacteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Domain Eukarya:</strong> All eukaryotes (Protista, Fungi, Plantae, Animalia are now kingdoms *within* this domain).</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be able to compare the systems. Whittaker's system is based on *morphology and nutrition*, while Woese's system is based on *genetics (rRNA)*. Woese's system is the current standard.
        </div>

        <h2 id="aseptic">3. Aseptic Techniques</h2>
        <p>Aseptic techniques refer to all methods used to prevent contamination of cultures, sterile equipment, or the experimenter with unwanted microorganisms.</p>
        
        <h3 id="sterilization">Sterilization</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition: Sterilization</strong> is the complete removal or destruction of *all* forms of microbial life, including vegetative cells, spores, and viruses. This is an absolute term; something is either sterile or it is not.

        <p>These agents are used to disinfect or sterilize. <strong>Disinfectants</strong> are used on inanimate objects, while <strong>antiseptics</strong> are used on living tissue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alcohols (Ethanol, Isopropanol):</strong> Denature proteins, dissolve lipids. Good for skin antiseptics and disinfecting surfaces. (Typically 70% concentration).</li>
            <li><strong>Halogens (Iodine, Chlorine):</strong> Oxidizing agents. Iodine (Betadine) is an antiseptic. Chlorine (bleach) is a disinfectant for water and surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Phenols (e.g., Lysol):</strong> Disrupt cell membranes, denature proteins. Stable and effective disinfectants.</li>
            <li><strong>Gases (Ethylene Oxide):</strong> Highly penetrating gas used for heat-sensitive materials like plastic petri dishes and catheters. It's an alkylating agent.</li>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition: Culture Medium</strong> (plural: media) is a nutrient-rich substance (liquid or solid) prepared in the lab to support the growth and multiplication of microorganisms.
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="media-types">Types of Culture Media</h3>
        <p>Media can be classified based on their consistency, composition, or purpose.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Based on Consistency:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Liquid (Broth) Media:</strong> No gelling agent. Used to grow large quantities of microbes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solid Media:</strong> Contains a gelling agent (usually 1.5-2.0% <strong>agar</strong>). Used for isolation, enumeration, and observing colony morphology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semi-solid Media:</strong> Contains a low concentration of agar (e.g., 0.5%). Used to study motility.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Based on Composition:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Defined (Synthetic) Media:</strong> The exact chemical composition is known (e.g., Czapek's medium).</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex (Undefined) Media:</strong> The exact composition is unknown. Contains complex ingredients like peptone, yeast extract, or beef extract (e.g., Nutrient Broth).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Based on Purpose:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Basal Media:</strong> Simple media that supports the growth of non-fastidious microbes (e.g., Nutrient Agar).</li>
                    <li><strong>Enriched Media:</strong> Basal media supplemented with extra nutrients like blood or serum (e.g., Blood Agar) for growing fastidious (picky) microbes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selective Media:</strong> Contains substances (e.g., antibiotics, dyes) that inhibit the growth of unwanted microbes and *select* for the desired ones (e.g., MacConkey Agar selects for Gram-negative bacteria).</li>
                    <li><strong>Differential Media:</strong> Contains indicators that allow for the differentiation of two types of microbes based on a biochemical property (e.g., MacConkey Agar differentiates lactose fermenters (pink) from non-fermenters (colorless)).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 id="media-prep">Preparation of Media (for Bacteria, Fungi, Actinomycetes)</h3>
        <p>The general steps are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Weighing:</strong> Accurately weigh the powdered components as per the formula.</li>
            <li><strong>Dissolving:</strong> Dissolve the components in the required volume of distilled water, usually with gentle heating. If it's an agar medium, it must be boiled to fully dissolve the agar.</li>
            <li><strong>pH Adjustment:</strong> Check the pH with a pH meter and adjust it to the required level (usually 6.8-7.2 for bacteria, 5.0-6.0 for fungi) using dilute HCl or NaOH.</li>
            <li><strong>Dispensing:</strong> Pour the medium into final containers (flasks, test tubes).</li>
            <li><strong>Sterilization:</strong> Sterilize the medium in an <strong>autoclave</strong> (121°C, 15 psi, 15-20 min).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Specific Media Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Bacteria:</strong> <strong>Nutrient Agar (NA) / Nutrient Broth (NB)</strong>. A complex, basal medium.</li>
            <li><strong>For Fungi:</strong> <strong>Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)</strong> or <strong>Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA)</strong>. These media have a high sugar content and a low pH, which inhibits bacterial growth.</li>
            <li><strong>For Actinomycetes:</strong> <strong>Actinomycete Isolation Agar (AIA)</strong> or <strong>Starch Casein Agar (SCA)</strong>. These may contain antibiotics like cycloheximide to inhibit fungi.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="isolation">5. Isolation of Pure Cultures</h2>
        <p>A <strong>pure culture</strong> contains only one species or strain of microorganism. Isolation is crucial for studying a specific microbe.</p>
        <p><strong>Streak Plate Method:</strong></p>
        <p>This is the most common technique used to obtain isolated colonies.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a sterile inoculating loop and pick up a sample (inoculum) from a mixed culture.</li>
            <li>Streak the inoculum back and forth in one quadrant of an agar plate.</li>
            <li>Sterilize the loop in a flame.</li>
            <li>Turn the plate 90 degrees. Drag the loop from the first quadrant into the second, spreading the bacteria.</li>
            <li>Sterilize the loop again.</li>
            <li>Turn the plate 90 degrees. Drag the loop from the second quadrant into the third.</li>
            <li>Sterilize the loop again and repeat for a fourth quadrant.</li>
            <li>Incubate the plate. The process mechanically dilutes the bacteria, so that in the final quadrants, individual cells are deposited. Each cell will grow into a visible, isolated <strong>colony</strong>, which is a pure culture.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="diagram-placeholder"></div>
        <p><strong>Other Methods:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spread Plate:</strong> A small volume of a *diluted* liquid sample is pipetted onto the surface of an agar plate and spread evenly with a sterile "hockey stick" (glass spreader).</li>
            <li><strong>Pour Plate:</strong> A diluted sample is mixed *with* molten (warm) agar and then poured into a sterile petri dish. Colonies grow both on the surface and embedded within the agar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="vaccines">6. Vaccines</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition: A vaccine</strong> is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. It "trains" the immune system to recognize and fight a pathogen.
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> A vaccine introduces a safe form of the pathogen (or a part of it), called an <strong>antigen</strong>, into the body. The immune system mounts a response, creating <strong>memory cells</strong> (T-cells and B-cells). If the body later encounters the *actual* pathogen, these memory cells launch a rapid and strong attack, preventing or (more commonly) reducing the severity of the disease.</p>
