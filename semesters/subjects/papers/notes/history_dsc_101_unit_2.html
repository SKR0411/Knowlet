        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction to Prehistory</h2>
        <p><strong>Prehistory</strong> refers to the period of human history <em>before</em> the invention of writing. Since there are no literary sources, our entire understanding is based on <strong>archaeological evidence</strong>: stone tools, fossils, cave paintings, and buried remains.</p>
        <p>This unit surveys the "Stone Age" and "Copper-Stone Age," tracking the evolution of early humans from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled farmers.</p>

        <h2 id="palaeolithic">2. Palaeolithic Culture (Old Stone Age)</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 500,000 BCE – 10,000 BCE)</em></p>
        
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Humans were <strong>nomadic hunter-gatherers</strong>. They lived in small groups, hunted large animals, and gathered plants, fruits, and nuts. They often lived in rock shelters (caves).</li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> The tools were crude, heavy, and unpolished, made from quartzite. They are often called "core tools" (made from the main block of stone) or "flake tools" (made from the flakes chipped off).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower Palaeolithic:</strong> Hand-axes, cleavers, and choppers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle Palaeolithic:</strong> Flake tools like scrapers, borers, and points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upper Palaeolithic:</strong> Emergence of blades and burins (for engraving).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> The very first examples of art appear in the form of cave paintings, such as those at <strong>Bhimbetka</strong> (Madhya Pradesh).</li>
            <li><strong>Key Sites:</strong> Soan Valley (Pakistan), Narmada Valley (Hathnora, where a human skull fragment was found), Bhimbetka (MP).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="mesolithic">3. Mesolithic Culture (Middle Stone Age)</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 10,000 BCE – 6,000 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>This was a <strong>transitional phase</strong> between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic. The climate became warmer and drier at the end of the Ice Age, leading to changes in flora and fauna.</p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Still primarily hunting and gathering, but they also began <strong>fishing</strong> and <strong>early animal domestication</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> The defining feature of this age is the <strong>MICROLITH</strong>. These were tiny, sharp, geometric stone tools (like triangles, crescents, and blades) that were used as barbs on arrows and spears.</li>
            <li><strong>Early Domestication:</strong> Sites like <strong>Adamgarh</strong> (MP) and <strong>Bagor</strong> (Rajasthan) show the earliest evidence of the domestication of animals (like sheep and goats).</li>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> The cave paintings at <strong>Bhimbetka</strong> flourished, showing scenes of hunting, dancing, and social life.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Sites:</strong> Bagor (Rajasthan), Adamgarh (MP), Bhimbetka (MP).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Remember this link:</strong> <strong>Mesolithic = Microliths</strong>. This is a very common question in exams.
        </div>

        <h2 id="neolithic">4. Neolithic Culture (New Stone Age)</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 6,000 BCE – 4,000 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>This period saw a fundamental change in human lifestyle, often called the <strong>"Neolithic Revolution."</strong></p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>The Neolithic Revolution:</strong> This was the world-changing shift from a <strong>food-gathering</strong> (hunting) economy to a <strong>food-producing</strong> (farming) economy.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Humans began cultivating crops like wheat, barley, and later rice. This is the <em>most important</em> development.</li>
            <li><strong>Domestication:</strong> Widespread domestication of animals (cattle, sheep, goats) for food, milk, and labour.</li>
            <li><strong>Sedentary Life:</strong> Agriculture forced people to settle in one place. This led to the <strong>first villages</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> The tools were now <strong>polished</strong>, well-finished, and ground, including celts (axes), adzes, and sickles.</li>
            <li><strong>Pottery:</strong> The invention of <strong>pottery</strong> was essential for storing surplus grain and water.</li>
            <li><strong>Burials:</strong> People began burying their dead in a systematic way, often with grave goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Sites:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mehrgarh (Pakistan):</strong> The <em>earliest known</em> agricultural settlement in South Asia. Shows a continuous evolution from 7000 BCE.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burzahom (Kashmir):</strong> Famous for its <strong>pit-dwellings</strong> (people lived in pits dug into the ground) and for burials where pets (like dogs) were buried with their owners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Koldihwa (UP):</strong> One of the earliest sites showing evidence of <strong>rice</strong> cultivation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="chalcolithic">5. Chalcolithic Culture (Copper-Stone Age)</h2>
        <p><em>(Approx. 4,000 BCE – 1,500 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>This period is defined by the <strong>first use of metal</strong>. <em>Chalco</em> = Copper, <em>Lithic</em> = Stone. People used <strong>copper tools</strong> alongside their advanced stone tools.</p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> This was a key technological leap. However, copper was scarce and expensive, so stone tools remained dominant.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> These were mostly <strong>rural, agricultural communities</strong>. They cultivated crops, herded animals, and lived in mud-brick houses.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Most Chalcolithic cultures were <em>rural</em>. The Harappan/Indus Valley Civilisation (which we study in Unit 3) was a more advanced <em>urban</em> culture (using bronze) that overlapped with this period.</li>
            <li><strong>Pottery:</strong> These cultures are famous for their distinctive painted pottery, such as <strong>Black-and-Red Ware</strong> and <strong>Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Cultures (Sites):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ahar-Banas Culture (Rajasthan):</strong> Known for copper smelting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malwa Culture (MP):</strong> Known for its distinctive pottery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jorwe Culture (Maharashtra):</strong> A major culture with sites like Daimabad.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
