        <h2 id="topic1">Multimeter</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Multimeter</strong> (or Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter, VOM) is an all-in-one electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. It is the most essential tool for working with electronics.</p>
        
        <h3>Use of Multimeter as...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ammeter (to measure Current):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Must be connected in <strong>SERIES</strong> with the component.</li>
                    <li><strong>How:</strong> You must "break" the circuit and insert the multimeter into the path, so the current flows *through* the meter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Principle:</strong> The meter has a very *low* internal resistance, so it doesn't affect the current it is trying to measure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Voltmeter (to measure Voltage):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Must be connected in <strong>PARALLEL</strong> (across) the component.</li>
                    <li><strong>How:</strong> You touch the two probes (red and black) to the two sides of the component you want to measure. The circuit is *not* broken.</li>
                    <li><strong>Principle:</strong> The meter has a very *high* internal resistance, so it draws almost no current from the circuit, thus not affecting the voltage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ohmmeter (to measure Resistance):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Must be used on a component that is <strong>OUT of the circuit</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>How:</strong> <strong>Turn all power OFF.</strong> Remove the resistor from the circuit (or at least one leg of it). Touch the probes to each end of the resistor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Principle:</strong> The meter sends a small, known current from its own battery through the resistor and measures the resulting voltage, calculating resistance using Ohm's Law (R = V/I).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>CRITICAL SAFETY MISTAKES:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Never</strong> connect an ohmmeter to a "live" (powered) circuit. You will destroy the meter.</li>
                <li><strong>Never</strong> connect an ammeter in *parallel* (like a voltmeter). This creates a short circuit through the meter's low resistance, which will blow the meter's fuse or destroy it.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Specifications of a good Multimeter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> How close the reading is to the true value (e.g., ±0.5%).</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The smallest change it can detect (related to the number of "counts" or digits on the display).</li>
            <li><strong>Input Impedance:</strong> A good voltmeter has a very high input impedance (e.g., > 10 MΩ) so it doesn't "load" the circuit.</li>
            <li><strong>True RMS:</strong> For measuring AC voltage, "True RMS" meters give an accurate reading even for non-sinusoidal waves (like from a dimmer switch), while cheaper meters are only accurate for perfect sine waves.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Rating (CAT):</strong> A "CAT III" or "CAT IV" rating means it is safe to use on high-energy mains-voltage circuits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Resistor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> `---[ ]---` (a zigzag line is also common)</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> To <strong>resist</strong> or <strong>limit</strong> the flow of electric current.</li>
            <li><strong>Governing Law:</strong> Ohm's Law (V = IR)</li>
            <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Its value (in Ohms, Ω) is printed on it or indicated by a "color code" (a series of colored bands).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Capacitor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> `---||---` (a straight line and a curved line is also common)</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> To <strong>store</strong> electrical energy in an electric field. It acts like a tiny, very fast rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li><strong>Property:</strong> It <strong>blocks</strong> steady DC current but <strong>passes</strong> changing AC current.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> Filtering, timing, and smoothing voltage supplies. (Unit: Farad, F)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Diode</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> `--->|---` (an arrow pointing at a bar)</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> A "one-way valve" for electricity. It allows current to flow easily in <strong>one direction</strong> (the direction of the arrow) but blocks it completely in the other direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> Converting AC to DC (rectification), protecting circuits from reverse voltage.</li>
            <li><strong>LED (Light Emitting Diode):</strong> A special type that emits light when current flows through it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>ICs (Integrated Circuits)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> A "chip." It is a complex circuit containing millions or even billions of tiny transistors, resistors, and capacitors all fabricated on a single, small piece of silicon.</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Acts as the "brain" of a device. (e.g., a microcontroller, a processor, or an amplifier).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>PCB (Printed Circuit Board)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> The green (or blue) board that all the components are soldered onto.</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> It provides <strong>mechanical support</strong> for the components and <strong>electrical connections</strong> between them using a pattern of copper "traces" (the shiny lines).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)</h2>
        <p>A <strong>CRO</strong> (or just "oscilloscope") is a test instrument that displays a graph of an electrical signal (Voltage) versus time. It allows you to "see" electricity.</p>
        
        <h3>Electron Gun</h3>
        <p>This is the part that creates the "pen" for drawing the graph.
        <ol>
            <li>A <strong>cathode</strong> (a metal filament) is heated, boiling off electrons (thermionic emission).</li>
            <li>A high positive voltage at the <strong>anodes</strong> (electrostatic acceleration) pulls these electrons and accelerates them into a very fast, narrow <strong>electron beam</strong>.</li>
            <li>A <strong>control grid</strong> (electrostatic focusing) changes the voltage to control the *number* of electrons, which changes the <strong>brightness</strong> of the dot on the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Uses of CRO</h3>
        <p>The beam then passes through two sets of "deflection plates" before hitting the fluorescent screen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Y-Plates (Vertical):</strong> The input signal (the "voltage" you want to see) is applied here. A positive voltage deflects the beam *up*, a negative voltage deflects it *down*.</li>
            <li><strong>X-Plates (Horizontal):</strong> The CRO's internal "timebase" generator applies a "sawtooth" voltage to these plates. This sweeps the beam from left-to-right at a constant speed, then instantly resets it to the left.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The combination of the vertical (Y) signal and the horizontal (X) time sweep "draws" the graph of <strong>Voltage vs. Time</strong> on the screen.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Uses:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Measuring voltages (AC and DC)</li>
            <li>Measuring frequencies and time periods</li>
            <li>Viewing the <strong>shape</strong> of a wave (e.g., sine, square, sawtooth)</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting and debugging electronic circuits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">Circuit Control and Safety Devices</h2>
        
        <h3>Regulated Power Supply</h3>
        <p>A device that converts the high-voltage, alternating current (AC) from the wall socket (e.g., 230V AC) into a steady, low-voltage, direct current (DC) (e.g., 5V DC) that electronics need. It "regulates" the output, meaning the voltage stays constant even if the input AC voltage or the load changes.</p>
        
        <h3>Relays</h3>
        <p>A <strong>relay</strong> is an <strong>electrically operated switch</strong>.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principle:</strong> It uses a *low-power* circuit to control a *high-power* circuit, while keeping them electrically isolated.</li>
            <li><strong>Working:</strong> A small current (e.g., from a 5V logic chip) energizes an <strong>electromagnet (a coil)</strong>. This magnet pulls a metal lever (an armature), which physically closes a switch in a separate, high-voltage circuit (e.g., a 230V light bulb or motor).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Fuses</h3>
        <p>A <strong>fuse</strong> is a simple safety device designed to protect a circuit from <strong>overcurrent</strong> (too much current).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Working:</strong> It is just a thin metal wire or filament enclosed in a non-combustible body.</li>
            <li>If the current in the circuit exceeds the fuse's rating (e.g., "5 Amps"), the thin wire gets extremely hot and <strong>melts ("blows")</strong>.</li>
            <li>This breaks the circuit, cutting off all power and protecting the expensive components from being destroyed.</li>
            <li>Fuses are "one-time-use" and must be replaced.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Switches</h3>
        <p>A mechanical device that manually opens (breaks) or closes (completes) an electrical circuit. (e.g., a light switch).</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic5">Electronic switch using transistor</h2>
        <p>A <strong>transistor</strong> (specifically, a Bipolar Junction Transistor or BJT) can be used as a solid-state switch, which has no moving parts and is much faster than a mechanical relay.</p>
        
        <p>A transistor has three terminals: <strong>Base (B), Collector (C), and Emitter (E)</strong>.</p>
        <p>The principle is that a <strong>small current flowing into the Base (I<sub>B</sub>)</strong> controls a <strong>large current flowing from the Collector to the Emitter (I<sub>C</sub>)</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Two States of the Switch:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>OFF State (Cut-off):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> We apply <strong>zero voltage/current</strong> to the Base (I<sub>B</sub> = 0).</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The transistor acts like an <strong>open switch</strong>. No current can flow from the Collector to the Emitter (I<sub>C</sub> = 0).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The LED or motor connected to the Collector remains OFF.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ON State (Saturation):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> We apply a <strong>small positive voltage/current</strong> to the Base (e.g., from a logic chip).</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The transistor "turns on" fully and acts like a <strong>closed switch</strong>. A large current is allowed to flow from the Collector to the Emitter (I<sub>C</sub> = max).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The LED or motor connected to the Collector turns ON.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is the fundamental principle behind all digital logic and computing. The "ON" and "OFF" states represent "1" and "0".</p>
