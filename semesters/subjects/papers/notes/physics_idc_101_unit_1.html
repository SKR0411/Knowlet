        <h2 id="topic1">Physical Quantities, Standards and Units</h2>
        
        <h3>Physical Quantities</h3>
        <p>A <strong>physical quantity</strong> is any property of a material or system that can be quantified by measurement. It is expressed as the combination of a numerical value and a unit.</p>
        <p>Example: Length = <strong>5 metres</strong> (5 is the numerical value, metres is the unit).</p>
        <p>There are two main types of physical quantities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fundamental (or Base) Quantities:</strong> These are the basic quantities that are independent of each other. They are not defined in terms of other quantities.</li>
            <li><strong>Derived Quantities:</strong> These are quantities that are formed by combining fundamental quantities through multiplication or division.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: <strong>Speed</strong> = Length / Time</li>
                    <li>Example: <strong>Force</strong> = Mass × (Length / Time²)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Standards and Units</h3>
        <p>A <strong>unit</strong> is a specific, agreed-upon "standard" amount of a physical quantity, used to measure other amounts of the same quantity. For a unit to be useful, it must be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Well-defined:</strong> Everyone agrees on its exact definition.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> It should be reproducible.</li>
            <li><strong>Invariable:</strong> It should not change over time or with location.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <strong>standard</strong> is the physical embodiment of a unit (e.g., the original platinum-iridium kilogram block in France was the *standard* for the *unit* "kilogram"). Modern standards are based on universal physical constants.</p>
        
        <h3>International System of Units (SI)</h3>
        <p>The SI (Système International d'Unités) is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement. It is built upon <strong>seven base units</strong> corresponding to seven fundamental quantities.</p>

        <h3>Standards of Time, Length and Mass</h3>
        <p>The definitions of the base units have evolved to become more precise, relying on fundamental constants of nature rather than physical objects.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard of Time (The Second):</strong>
                <br>The second (s) is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the <strong>caesium frequency</strong>, Δν<sub>Cs</sub>, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9,192,631,770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s⁻¹. This is the principle behind <strong>atomic clocks</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Standard of Length (The Metre):</strong>
                <br>The metre (m) is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the <strong>speed of light in vacuum (c)</strong> to be 299,792,458 when expressed in the unit m/s.
                <br>This means 1 metre is the distance light travels in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Standard of Mass (The Kilogram):</strong>
                <br>The kilogram (kg) is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the <strong>Planck constant (h)</strong> to be 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ when expressed in the unit J·s, which is equal to kg·m²·s⁻¹. This definition is now based on a fundamental constant, replacing the old physical "Le Grand K" cylinder.

        <h2 id="topic2">Energy</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Energy</strong> is defined as the capacity to do work.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is a scalar quantity, and its SI unit is the <strong>Joule (J)</strong>. (1 Joule = 1 Newton-metre)</p>
        
        <h3>Kinetic Energy (K)</h3>
        <p>Kinetic Energy is the energy an object possesses due to its <strong>motion</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>K = (1/2) mv²</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>`m` = mass of the object (in kg)</li>
            <li>`v` = speed of the object (in m/s)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you double the mass of an object, you double its kinetic energy. But if you <strong>double the speed</strong>, you <strong>quadruple (2²) its kinetic energy</strong>. This is why high-speed car crashes are so much more destructive.</p>
        
        <h3>Potential Energy (U)</h3>
        <p>Potential Energy is stored energy an object possesses due to its <strong>position or configuration</strong> (its shape).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy (U<sub>g</sub>):</strong> Energy stored by an object due to its height in a gravitational field.
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>U<sub>g</sub> = mgh</strong>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>`m` = mass (kg)</li>
                    <li>`g` = acceleration due to gravity (≈ 9.8 m/s²)</li>
                    <li>`h` = height (m) above a reference point</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Elastic Potential Energy (U<sub>e</sub>):</strong> Energy stored in a stretched or compressed elastic object, like a spring or rubber band.
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>U<sub>e</sub> = (1/2) kx²</strong>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>`k` = spring constant (in N/m)</li>
                    <li>`x` = displacement from the equilibrium (unstretched) position (m)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">Work and Power</h2>
        
        <h3>Work (W)</h3>
        <p>In physics, <strong>work</strong> is done when a force (F) acts on an object, causing it to have a displacement (d) in the direction of the force.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>W = F × d × cos(θ)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>`F` = magnitude of the force (in Newtons)</li>
            <li>`d` = magnitude of the displacement (in metres)</li>
            <li>`θ` = angle between the force and the displacement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The SI unit of work is the <strong>Joule (J)</strong>. 1 J = 1 N·m.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Points about Work:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If force is perpendicular to displacement (θ = 90°), <strong>no work is done</strong> (cos 90° = 0). Example: Carrying a heavy bag horizontally. Your force is up, displacement is forward, so you do no *physical* work on the bag (even though you get tired!).</li>
                <li>Work can be negative if the force opposes the motion (e.g., work done by friction).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Power (P)</h3>
        <p><strong>Power</strong> is the <strong>rate</strong> at which work is done, or the rate at which energy is transferred.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>P = W / t   (Average Power)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>`W` = work done (in Joules)</li>
            <li>`t` = time taken (in seconds)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The SI unit of power is the <strong>Watt (W)</strong>. <strong>1 Watt = 1 Joule per second (1 J/s)</strong>.</p>
        <p>A common non-SI unit is <strong>horsepower (hp)</strong>. 1 hp ≈ 746 W.</p>
        <p>An alternative formula for instantaneous power is: <strong>P = F × v</strong> (Force × velocity).</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic4">Conversion of Energy</h2>
        <p>This is the <strong>First Law of Thermodynamics</strong>, also known as the <strong>Principle of Conservation of Energy</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another.</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant.</p>
        
        <h3>Daily Life Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A falling ball:</strong> At the top, it has maximum Potential Energy (mgh). As it falls, `h` decreases (U decreases) and `v` increases (K increases). Its PE is converted into KE.</li>
            <li><strong>A light bulb:</strong> <strong>Electrical energy</strong> is converted into <strong>light energy</strong> and <strong>heat energy</strong> (waste).</li>
            <li><strong>A car:</strong> <strong>Chemical energy</strong> (in petrol) is converted by the engine into <strong>kinetic energy</strong> (motion) and <strong>heat energy</strong> (waste).</li>
            <li><strong>A hydroelectric dam:</strong> <strong>Gravitational potential energy</strong> (of the water held high) is converted into <strong>kinetic energy</strong> (of the falling water), which turns a turbine (<strong>mechanical energy</strong>), which runs a generator to produce <strong>electrical energy</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> <strong>Radiant energy</strong> (sunlight) is converted by plants into <strong>chemical energy</strong> (sugars).</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic5">Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy</h2>
        
        <h3>Non-Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>These are energy sources that are finite and cannot be replenished on a human timescale. They are "used up."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fossil Fuels (Coal, Oil, Natural Gas):</strong> Formed from the remains of dead plants and animals over millions of years.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> High energy density, relatively cheap, established technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Produce greenhouse gases (like CO₂) when burned, causing global warming and climate change; cause air pollution (smog); finite supply.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Nuclear Fuel (Uranium):</strong> Energy is released through nuclear fission.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely high energy output, no greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Creates radioactive waste that is dangerous for thousands of years; risk of accidents (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>These are energy sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. They are "sustainable."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> Energy from the sun's radiation.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Clean (no emissions), abundant, getting cheaper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Intermittent (doesn't work at night), requires large land area.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Kinetic energy of moving air (wind) turns turbines.
                <ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">Heat Energy</h2>
        <p><strong>Heat</strong> is a form of energy that is transferred between systems or objects with different temperatures. Heat is "energy in transit."</p>
        <p><strong>Temperature</strong> is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance.</p>
        <p>Heat energy always flows from a <strong>hotter</strong> object to a <strong>colder</strong> object until they reach thermal equilibrium.</p>
        
        <h3>Units of Heat Energy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Joule (J):</strong> The SI unit of energy. Since heat is energy, its SI unit is the Joule.</li>
            <li><strong>Calorie (cal):</strong> An older, common unit.
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>1 calorie =</strong> the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Food Calorie (Cal):</strong> This is actually a kilocalorie (kcal).
                <br><strong>1 Calorie = 1000 calories = 1 kcal</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conversion:</strong> <strong>1 cal ≈ 4.184 J</strong></p>

        <h3>Energy Flow</h3>
        <p>An <strong>energy flow diagram</strong> (or Sankey diagram) is a visual way to show the conversion of energy. It illustrates the law of conservation of energy by showing all the outputs, including useful energy and wasted energy.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: Incandescent Light Bulb</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input:</strong> 100% Electrical Energy</li>
            <li><strong>Useful Output:</strong> ~5-10% Light Energy</li>
            <li><strong>Wasted Output:</strong> ~90-95% Heat Energy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Measuring Energy</h3>
        <p>We don't usually measure energy directly; we measure other quantities and calculate it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Measuring Electrical Energy:</strong> Your home's <strong>electricity meter</strong> measures power (in kilowatts) and the time (in hours). It displays energy in <strong>kilowatt-hours (kWh)</strong>.
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>1 kWh = 1 kilowatt × 1 hour</strong>
                    <br>1 kWh = (1000 J/s) × (3600 s) = 3,600,000 J = 3.6 MJ
                </blockquote>
                This "unit" on your electricity bill is a unit of energy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Measuring Heat Energy:</strong> A <strong>calorimeter</strong> is used in a lab. It's an insulated container where a reaction takes place. By measuring the temperature change (ΔT) of a known mass (m) of water, we can calculate the heat absorbed or released using `Q = mcΔT` (where `c` is the specific heat capacity).</li>

        <h2 id="topic8">Power Sources</h2>
        <p>This refers to the *source* that provides the energy to be converted. We have already discussed many of these in the "Renewable/Non-Renewable" section.</p>
        
        <h3>Common Daily Power Sources:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electrical Grid:</strong> This is our main "source." The grid itself is powered by a mix of primary sources:
                <ul>
                    <li>Thermal (Coal, Natural Gas)</li>
                    <li>Hydroelectric (Dams)</li>
                    <li>Nuclear</li>
                    <li>Renewable (Solar, Wind)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Batteries (Chemical Energy):</strong> Portable power sources that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy via an electrochemical reaction.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary (Non-rechargeable):</strong> e.g., Alkaline batteries (for remotes). The reaction is one-way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary (Rechargeable):</strong> e.g., Lithium-ion batteries (in phones, laptops, electric cars). The reaction can be reversed by applying an external current.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Internal Combustion Engine (Chemical Energy):</strong> Uses chemical energy from fuel (petrol, diesel) to produce mechanical power for vehicles.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar Cells (Radiant Energy):</strong> Convert sunlight directly into electrical power. Used in calculators, satellites, and solar farms.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Body (Chemical Energy):</strong> Your muscles convert chemical energy from food into mechanical power to walk, lift, or ride a bike. An average human can sustain about 100 Watts of power.</li>
