            <h2>1. Definition, Composition, and Importance</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition: Lithosphere</h3>
            <blockquote>
                The <strong>Lithosphere</strong> is the rigid, rocky outer layer of the Earth. It consists of the <strong>crust</strong> and the solid, upper part of the <strong>mantle</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>The lithosphere is what is broken into the <strong>tectonic plates</strong> that move and "float" on the semi-molten asthenosphere below.</p>
            
            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>The lithosphere is composed of rocks, which are in turn made of minerals. The most abundant minerals are <strong>silicates</strong> (e.g., quartz, feldspar), and the most abundant elements are <strong>Oxygen (O)</strong> and <strong>Silicon (Si)</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Lithosphere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat for Life:</strong> It provides the physical foundation (land) for most terrestrial life.</li>
                <li><strong>Source of Soil:</strong> The <strong>soil</strong>, which is the basis for all agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems, is formed from the weathering of the lithosphere's rocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Source of Resources:</strong> It is the source of all our mineral resources (e.g., iron, aluminum) and energy resources (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas, which are stored within its rocks).</li>
                <li><strong>Plate Tectonics:</strong> The movement of the lithosphere (plate tectonics) drives the rock cycle, forms mountains, and causes earthquakes and volcanoes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="layers">
            <h2>2. Formation and Composition of Core, Mantle, and Crust</h2>
            <p>During the Earth's early molten state, it underwent <strong>differentiation</strong>, where heavy elements sank to the center and light elements floated to the top. This created the Earth's layered structure.</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A cross-section of the Earth showing the main chemical layers.
                <br>1. <strong>Crust:</strong> Outermost, thin, low-density (silicates).
                <br>2. <strong>Mantle:</strong> Thick middle layer, medium-density (iron-magnesium silicates).
                <br>3. <strong>Core:</strong> Innermost, very thick, high-density (Iron-Nickel).
            </div>
            
            <h3>Core</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Formed as the heaviest elements (iron and nickel) sank to the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Primarily <strong>Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> It is divided into two parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inner Core:</strong> A <strong>solid</strong> sphere (solid due to immense pressure).</li>
                        <li><strong>Outer Core:</strong> A <strong>liquid</strong> layer. The flow of this liquid metal generates Earth's magnetic field.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mantle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Formed from the "middle-weight" elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Composed of hot, dense, silicate rocks rich in <strong>iron and magnesium</strong> (e.g., peridotite).</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> It is a "plastic solid" that flows very slowly over geologic time (like thick tar). This slow, circular movement is called <strong>mantle convection</strong> and is what drives plate tectonics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Crust</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formation:</strong> The lightest, least-dense materials floated to the top and cooled.</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Rich in <strong>silicon and oxygen</strong> (silicates).</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> It is the thin, brittle outer "skin." There are two types:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Continental Crust:</strong> Thicker, less dense, granitic. (Forms continents).</li>
                        <li><strong>Oceanic Crust:</strong> Thinner, more dense, basaltic. (Forms ocean floor).</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>3. Composition and Formation of Soil</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition: Soil</h3>
            <p>Soil is the thin upper layer of the lithosphere, at the interface of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. It is a complex mixture of weathered rock, organic matter, water, and air that is capable of supporting plant life.</p>
            
            <h3>Composition of a Typical Soil</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>~45% Mineral Matter:</strong> Weathered rock particles (sand, silt, clay).</li>
                <li><strong>~5% Organic Matter (Humus):</strong> Decomposed plant and animal material. This is vital for fertility and water retention.</li>
                <li><strong>~25% Water:</strong> Held in pore spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>~25% Air:</strong> Held in pore spaces.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Formation of Soil (Pedogenesis)</h3>
            <p>Soil forms very slowly from the "top down." The process is governed by five key factors (CLORPT):</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>CL - Climate:</strong> The most important factor. Temperature and precipitation determine the speed and type of weathering (e.g., warm, wet climates form thick soils quickly).</li>
                <li><strong>O - Organisms (Biota):</strong> Plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi add organic matter (humus) and help weather rock.</li>
                <li><strong>R - Relief (Topography):</strong> The shape of the land. Steep slopes have thin, poorly developed soils due to high erosion. Flat valleys have thick, well-developed soils.</li>
                <li><strong>P - Parent Material:</strong> The type of rock the soil is forming from. This determines the soil's initial texture and chemical composition (e.g., limestone parent rock leads to an alkaline soil).</li>
                <li><strong>T - Time:</strong> Soil formation is a very slow process, taking hundreds to thousands of years to form just a few centimeters.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="soil-properties">
            <h2>4. Physical Properties of Soil</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Texture:</strong> Refers to the <strong>particle size</strong> of the mineral components. It is the relative proportion of <strong>sand</strong> (largest particle), <strong>silt</strong> (medium), and <strong>clay</strong> (smallest particle).
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Loam:</strong> A soil with a balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay, often considered ideal for agriculture.</li>
                        <li>Texture is critical because it determines porosity and permeability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Soil Structure:</strong> The way soil particles (sand, silt, clay) clump together to form aggregates (or "peds"). Good structure (e.g., granular) allows for good water infiltration and root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Porosity:</strong> The total amount of pore space (empty space) within a soil. Clay soils have high porosity but tiny pores.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Permeability:</strong> The ability of water and air to move *through* the soil. Sandy soils have high permeability. Clay soils have very low permeability.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Colour:</strong> Can indicate its properties. Dark soils are rich in organic matter (humus). Red/yellow soils indicate iron oxidation.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="soil-profile">
            <h2>5. Soil Profile</h2>
            <p>A <strong>soil profile</strong> is a vertical cross-section of the soil from the surface down to the underlying parent material. It shows distinct layers, called <strong>horizons</strong>, that have formed over time.</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A vertical cross-section of soil, showing the layers:
                <br><strong>O Horizon:</strong> (Organic) Surface layer of fresh and decaying leaves, twigs (humus).
                <br><strong>A Horizon:</strong> (Topsoil) Dark-colored. A mixture of mineral particles and humus. High in biological activity.
                <br><strong>B Horizon:</strong> (Subsoil) Lighter in color. Zone of accumulation, where minerals and clays leached (washed down) from the A horizon are deposited.
                <br><strong>C Horizon:</strong> (Regolith) Partially weathered/broken parent rock. Very little organic matter.
                <br><strong>R Horizon:</strong> (Bedrock) Unweathered, solid parent rock.
            </div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>O Horizon (Organic):</strong> The surface layer of fresh and decomposing organic matter (leaves, litter).</li>
                <li><strong>A Horizon (Topsoil):</strong> A mix of mineral particles and dark, rich humus. This is the most biologically active layer and is crucial for plant growth.</li>
                <li><strong>B Horizon (Subsoil):Please do not use LaTeX formatting for mathematical and scientific notations. Instead, write them in plain text.
                    For example:
                    
                    Write E = mc² instead of $E = mc^2$.
                    
                    Write λ = h / p instead of $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$.
                    
                    Write (Δx)(Δp) ≥ h / 4π instead of $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4\pi}$.
                    </strong> Usually lighter in color, with less humus. It's a "zone of accumulation" where minerals and clay particles (leached from the A horizon by water) are deposited.</li>
                <li><strong>C Horizon (Regolith):</strong> Composed of partially weathered parent material (broken rock). It is the first stage in soil formation.</li>
                <li><strong>R Horizon (Bedrock):</strong> The solid, unweathered parent rock at the base.</li>

        <section id="soil-water">
            <h2>6. Soil Water</h2>
            <p>Water held in the pore spaces of the soil. It is crucial for making nutrients available to plants (nutrients must be dissolved in water to be absorbed by roots).</p>
            <p>There are three main types of soil water:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Water:</strong> Water that fills the large pore spaces after a heavy rain and is rapidly pulled downward by gravity. It drains quickly and is not available to plants for long.</li>
                <li><strong>Capillary Water:</strong> Water held in the small "micropores" of the soil against the pull of gravity (by adhesion and cohesion). <strong>This is the primary form of water that is available for plants to absorb.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Hygroscopic Water:</strong> A very thin film of water bound so tightly to the surface of soil particles that it cannot be removed by plant roots. This water is unavailable to plants.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Field Capacity:</strong> The amount of water left in a soil after the gravitational water has drained away. (Capillary + Hygroscopic water).
            <br><strong>Wilting Point:</strong> The point at which all capillary water is used up, and only hygroscopic water remains. Plants will wilt and die.</p>

        <section id="soil-conservation">
            <h2>7. Soil Conservation</h2>
            <p><strong>Soil erosion</strong> is the removal of topsoil by the agents of wind and water, a process greatly accelerated by human activities like deforestation, overgrazing, and improper agriculture.</p>
            <p><strong>Soil conservation</strong> is the set of practices and strategies used to protect the soil from erosion and maintain its fertility.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Conservation Methods:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aforestation and Reforestation:</strong> Planting trees. Tree roots bind the soil, and the canopy protects the soil from rain and wind.</li>
                <li><strong>Contour Ploughing:</strong> Ploughing *across* the slope of a hill instead of up and down. Each furrow acts like a small dam, trapping water and preventing it from washing soil downhill.</li>
                <li><strong>Terracing:</strong> Building a series of "steps" or terraces on steep hillsides. This slows down water runoff and creates flat areas for farming.</li>
                <li><strong>Strip Cropping:</strong> Planting alternating strips of different crops in the same field (e.g., a strip of corn, then a strip of hay). The cover crop (hay) traps soil that may erode from the row crop (corn).</li>
                <li><strong>Cover Crops / Mulching:</strong> Planting crops like clover during the off-season, or covering the soil with mulch (like straw), so that the soil is never left bare and exposed to wind and rain.</li>
                <li><strong>No-Till Farming:</strong> A method where farmers plant new seeds directly into the residue of the previous crop, without ploughing the soil. This drastically reduces erosion.</li>
            </ul>
