        <h2 id="intro">1. <span id="span_44">Introduction to Parliamentary Committees</span></h2>
        <p>A significant portion of Parliament's work is conducted through committees. Given the size of the Parliament and the complexity of its tasks, it is impossible to scrutinize every matter in detail on the floor of the House. <span id="span_45">Committees are small groups of MPs appointed to examine specific issues.</span></p>
        <blockquote>
            Parliamentary Committees are often called <strong>"miniature legislatures"</strong>. They provide the technical expertise and in-depth scrutiny that the full House cannot.
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="types">2. <span id="span_46">Types of Committees</span></h2>
        <p>Parliamentary committees can be broadly classified into two categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Standing Committees:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are <strong>permanent</strong> committees constituted every year.</li>
                    <li>They work on a continuous basis.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Financial Committees, Departmental Standing Committees (DRSCs), Committee on Petitions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ad-hoc Committees:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are <strong>temporary</strong> committees created for a specific purpose.</li>
                    <li>They are dissolved once they have completed their task and submitted a report.</li>
                    <li>Examples: <strong>Select Committees</strong> (to examine a particular bill), <strong>Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPCs)</strong> (set up to investigate a specific matter or scandal).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="standing">3. <span id="span_47">Role of Standing Committees</span></h2>
        <p>The most important standing committees are the <strong>Departmentally Related Standing Committees (DRSCs)</strong>, first set up in 1993. There are 24 DRSCs, each covering a specific ministry or group of ministries (e.g., DRSC on Home Affairs, DRSC on Defence).</p>
        <span id="span_48"><span id="span_49"><p>Their key roles include:</span></span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scrutiny of Bills:</strong> When a bill is introduced, it is often referred to the relevant DRSC. The committee examines it in detail, invites expert opinions, and suggests amendments. This makes the law-making process more thorough.</li>
            <li><strong>Examination of Demands for Grants:</strong> Before the Parliament votes on the budget, the "Demands for Grants" of each ministry are sent to the respective DRSC. The committee examines the demands and tables a report. This strengthens financial control.</li>
            <li><strong>Reviewing Policy Documents:</strong> They examine long-term policy documents presented by ministries.</li>
            <li><strong>Overall Oversight:</strong> They act as a watchdog over their respective ministries, ensuring accountability even after the budget is passed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="finance">4. <span id="span_50">Role of Finance Committees</span></h2>
        <span id="span_51"><span id="span_52"><p>These are the three most powerful standing committees, crucial for ensuring the financial accountability of the executive.</span></span></p>

                    <td><strong>Estimates Committee</strong></td>

                    <td>To examine the budget *estimates* and suggest "economies" (ways to spend more efficiently). It is a "continuous economy committee."</td>

            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Remember the key difference:
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Estimates Committee</strong> is like a pre-mortem: it looks at *estimates* before spending.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Public Accounts Committee</strong> is like a post-mortem: it looks at *accounts* after spending, guided by the CAG report.</li>
