        <h3 id="subtopic1-1">Characteristics and economic importance</h3>
        
        <h4>Characteristics of Viruses</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Viruses are acellular, non-living, obligate intracellular parasites. They are infectious particles rather than organisms, consisting of a nucleic acid core (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat (capsid).
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-living Nature:</strong> They are metabolically inert outside a host cell. They lack cellular machinery (ribosomes, enzymes) for self-replication. They can be crystallized.</li>
            <li><strong>Living Nature (inside host):</strong> They can replicate, mutate, and evolve. They use the host cell's machinery to synthesize new viral components.</li>
            <li><strong>Size:</strong> Extremely small (ultramicroscopic), ranging from 20 to 300 nm. They can pass through bacteriological filters.</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> At its simplest, a virus (or <strong>virion</strong>) consists of:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Genome:</strong> The genetic material. Can be DNA or RNA, but never both. It can be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds).</li>
                    <li><strong>Capsid:</strong> A protein coat that surrounds and protects the genome. It is made of subunits called <strong>capsomeres</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Envelope (Optional):</strong> A lipid membrane derived from the host cell that surrounds the capsid in some viruses (e.g., Influenza virus, HIV). Viruses without it are "naked" viruses.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Host Specificity:</strong> Viruses are highly specific to their hosts (e.g., bacteriophages infect bacteria, TMV infects plants).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Economic Importance</h4>
        <h5>Negative Importance (Harmful Effects)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Diseases:</strong> Cause numerous diseases, from the common cold and influenza to severe illnesses like COVID-19, AIDS (HIV), measles, and polio.</li>
            <li><strong>Plant Diseases:</strong> Cause significant crop losses. Examples include Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, and Citrus Tristeza Virus.</li>
            <li><strong>Animal Diseases:</strong> Cause diseases in livestock, such as Foot-and-mouth disease and Avian influenza, leading to economic losses.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Positive Importance (Beneficial Effects)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic Engineering:</strong> Viruses (especially bacteriophages and retroviruses) are used as <strong>vectors</strong> to carry desired genes into cells for gene therapy and biotechnology.</li>
            <li><strong>Phage Therapy:</strong> Using bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections, especially those resistant to antibiotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Control:</strong> Used as biopesticides to control specific insect pests (e.g., Baculoviruses).</li>
            <li><strong>Vaccine Production:</strong> Viruses (either weakened or inactivated) are the basis for most vaccines, which train the immune system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic1-2">T-phage: Structure and lytic cycle</h3>
        <p><strong>T-phages</strong> (e.g., T2, T4, T6) are a group of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) that infect <em>Escherichia coli</em> (E. coli). They are "T-even" phages.</p>
        
        <h4>Structure of T-phage (e.g., T4)</h4>
        <p>T-phages have a complex, "tadpole-like" structure.</p>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: Labeled structure of T4 Bacteriophage]</strong>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Head:</strong> An elongated icosahedral head, containing the genome (a single linear molecule of <strong>dsDNA</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Tail:</strong> A complex, contractile tail assembly.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collar:</strong> Connects the head to the tail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Core:</strong> A hollow tube through which the DNA passes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sheath:</strong> A contractile protein sheath surrounding the core.</li>
                    <li><strong>Base Plate:</strong> A hexagonal plate at the bottom of the tail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tail Fibers:</strong> Six long fibers attached to the base plate. They act as "legs" to recognize and attach to the host bacterium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tail Pins:</strong> Short pins on the base plate that anchor the phage to the cell.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Lytic Cycle (Virulent Cycle)</h4>
        <p>The lytic cycle is a viral replication cycle that results in the <strong>death and lysis (bursting)</strong> of the host cell. This is the "aggressive" cycle.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Attachment (Adsorption):</strong> The phage's tail fibers recognize and bind to specific receptor sites on the outer surface of the <i>E. coli</i> cell wall.</li>
            <li><strong>Penetration (Injection):</strong> The base plate anchors to the cell. The contractile sheath contracts, driving the core tube through the cell wall. The phage injects its DNA into the bacterial cytoplasm, leaving the empty capsid ("ghost") outside.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthesis (Replication):</strong> The phage DNA takes over the host cell's machinery.
                <ul>
                    <li>Host DNA and protein synthesis are shut down.</li>
                    <li>The viral DNA is replicated many times.</li>
                    <li>The viral DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated by host ribosomes to make viral proteins (capsid proteins, tail proteins, and enzymes like lysozyme).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assembly (Maturation):</strong> The newly synthesized viral components are assembled into new, complete phage particles (virions). Heads are packed with DNA, and tails are attached.</li>
            <li><strong>Release (Lysis):</strong> The phage produces <strong>lysozyme</strong>, an enzyme that degrades the bacterial cell wall from within. The cell swells and bursts (lyses), releasing 100-200 new phage particles, which can then infect neighboring bacteria.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="subtopic1-3">TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> The first virus to be discovered (by Ivanovsky and Beijerinck).</li>
            <li><strong>Host:</strong> Infects tobacco plants and other members of the Solanaceae family (like tomato).</li>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Causes a "mosaic" pattern (light green/yellow patches) on leaves, mottling, and stunting.</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A simple, <strong>rod-shaped</strong>, non-enveloped virus.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Genome:</strong> A single molecule of <strong>ssRNA</strong> (single-stranded RNA).</li>
                    <li><strong>Capsid:</strong> The capsid is a rigid helix made of ~2130 identical capsomere proteins, arranged like a spiral staircase. The ssRNA genome is coiled and embedded within this protein helix.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Extremely stable. Transmitted mechanically (e.g., on contaminated tools, hands, or by infected plant sap), not by insect vectors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic1-4">Lysogenic cycle (Temperate Cycle)</h3>
        <p>This is an alternative replication cycle for some phages (called <strong>temperate phages</strong>, e.g., Phage Lambda). It is a "stealth" cycle where the virus co-exists peacefully with its host.</p>
        <div class="placeholder">
            <strong>[Diagram: Comparing the Lytic and Lysogenic Cycles]</strong>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Attachment & Penetration:</strong> Same as the lytic cycle (the phage injects its DNA).</li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Instead of taking over, the phage DNA <strong>integrates</strong> itself into a specific site on the host bacterial chromosome. The integrated phage DNA is now called a <strong>prophage</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Replication:</strong> The prophage is dormant and harmless. It is copied and passed on to daughter cells just like any other bacterial gene every time the bacterium divides by binary fission. The bacterium carrying the prophage is called a <strong>lysogenic cell</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Induction:</strong> The prophage can remain integrated for many generations. However, if the host cell is exposed to stress (e.g., UV radiation, chemicals), this triggers "induction" – the prophage DNA excises (cuts) itself out of the bacterial chromosome.</li>
            <li><strong>Entry into Lytic Cycle:</strong> Once excised, the viral DNA immediately enters the lytic cycle (Step 3: Synthesis), leading to replication, assembly, and lysis of the host cell.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic2">Bacteria</h2>
        <h3 id="subtopic2-1">Characteristics and economic importance</h3>

        <h4>Characteristics of Bacteria</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prokaryotic:</strong> They are single-celled organisms that <strong>lack a true, membrane-bound nucleus</strong> and other membrane-bound organelles (mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Genome:</strong> The genetic material is a single, circular DNA molecule located in the cytoplasm in a region called the <strong>nucleoid</strong>. They may also have <strong>plasmids</strong> (small, extrachromosomal DNA rings).</li>
            <li><strong>Cell Wall:</strong> Most bacteria have a rigid cell wall (outside the cell membrane) for shape and protection. The key component is <strong>peptidoglycan</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Ribosomes:</strong> They have 70S ribosomes (smaller than eukaryotic 80S ribosomes). This is a key target for antibiotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Primarily reproduce asexually by <strong>binary fission</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolic Diversity:</strong> They exhibit the most diverse metabolic strategies on Earth (e.g., photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, aerobic/anaerobic respiration, fermentation).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Economic Importance</h4>
        <h5>Negative Importance (Harmful Effects)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Disease:</strong> Cause many diseases (e.g., Tuberculosis, Cholera, Tetanus, Pneumonia, Typhoid).</li>
            <li><strong>Food Spoilage:</strong> Saprophytic bacteria cause food to rot and spoil (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* causes botulism).</li>
            <li><strong>Denitrification:</strong> Some soil bacteria (e.g., *Pseudomonas*) convert useful nitrates back into N<sub>2</sub> gas, reducing soil fertility.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Positive Importance (Beneficial Effects)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> As saprophytes, they are the primary decomposers in ecosystems, recycling nutrients (C, N, P, S).</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture (Nitrogen Fixation):</strong> Bacteria like <em>Rhizobium</em> (symbiotic) and <em>Azotobacter</em> (free-living) fix atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> into ammonia, a natural fertilizer.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Industry (Fermentation):</strong> Used to produce yogurt, cheese (<em>Lactobacillus</em>), vinegar (<em>Acetobacter</em>), and pickles.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Production:</strong> Used in bioreactors to produce antibiotics (<em>Streptomyces</em>), enzymes, vitamins, and organic acids.</li>
            <li><strong>Biotechnology:</strong> <em>E. coli</em> is the "workhorse" of genetic engineering, used to produce recombinant proteins like human insulin.</li>
            <li><strong>Bioremediation:</strong> Some bacteria can digest oil spills and clean up toxic waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Digestion:</strong> <em>E. coli</em> in the human intestine produces Vitamin K.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subtopic2-2">Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Gram Stain</strong> (developed by Hans Christian Gram) is the most important differential staining technique in bacteriology. It divides most bacteria into two groups based on differences in their <strong>cell wall structure</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4>Gram Stain Procedure (Summary)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Primary Stain:</strong> Crystal Violet (stains all cells purple).</li>
            <li><strong>Mordant:</strong> Gram's Iodine (forms a C-V-I complex).</li>
            <li><strong>Decolorizer:</strong> Alcohol/Acetone (the key differential step).</li>
            <li><strong>Counterstain:</strong> Safranin (stains decolorized cells pink/red).</li>
