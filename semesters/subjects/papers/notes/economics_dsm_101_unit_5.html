        <h2 id="topic1">National Income Concepts (GNP, GDP, NNP, NDP)</h2>
        <p>National Income is the total monetary value of all <strong>final goods and services</strong> produced in an economy during a given period (usually one year).</p>
        
        <h3>Key Conversion Rules:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gross vs. Net:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gross</strong> = Total value produced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net</strong> = Total value minus <strong>Depreciation</strong> (wear and tear of capital).</li>
                    <li><strong>Net = Gross - Depreciation</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Domestic vs. National:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Domestic</strong> = Produced *within the geographical territory* of a country (by anyone).</li>
                    <li><strong>National</strong> = Produced *by normal residents (nationals)* of a country (anywhere in the world).</li>
                    <li><strong>National = Domestic + Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA)</strong></li>
                    <li>(NFIA = Factor income earned by residents from abroad - Factor income paid to non-residents)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market Price (MP) vs. Factor Cost (FC):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Price</strong> = What the consumer actually pays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Factor Cost</strong> = What the producer actually receives.</li>
                    <li><strong>MP = FC + Net Indirect Taxes (NIT)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>FC = MP - Net Indirect Taxes (NIT)</strong></li>
                    <li>(NIT = Indirect Taxes - Subsidies)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>The Main Aggregates:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GDP_MP (Gross Domestic Product at Market Prices):</strong> Total market value of all final goods and services produced <em>within the domestic territory</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>GNP_MP (Gross National Product at Market Prices):</strong> Total market value of all final goods and services produced <em>by the normal residents</em>.
                <br><span class="formula">GNP_MP = GDP_MP + NFIA</span></li>
            <li><strong>NDP_MP (Net Domestic Product at Market Prices):</strong>
                <br><span class="formula">NDP_MP = GDP_MP - Depreciation</span></li>
            <li><strong>NNP_MP (Net National Product at Market Prices):</strong>
                <br><span class="formula">NNP_MP = GNP_MP - Depreciation</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>National Income (NI)</strong> is officially defined as <strong>Net National Product at Factor Cost (NNP_FC)</strong>.
            <br>
            <span class="formula">NI = NNP_FC = NNP_MP - Net Indirect Taxes (NIT)</span>

        <h2 id="topic2">Personal Income Concepts (Private, Personal, Per Capita)</h2>
        
        <h3>Private Income</h3>
        <p><strong>Private Income</strong> is the total income earned by the <strong>private sector</strong> (households and private firms) from all sources (both earned and unearned).</p>
        <span class="formula">Private Income = (NI) - (Income from property/entrepreneurship accruing to Govt) - (Savings of Non-Departmental Enterprises) + (All Transfer Payments)</span>
        
        <h3>Personal Income (PI)</h3>
        <p><strong>Personal Income</strong> is the income actually <strong>received by households and individuals</strong> from all sources *before* paying personal taxes.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            PI = Private Income - Undistributed Corporate Profits - Corporate Taxes
        </span>
        <p><em>(It is the income households get, so we must remove the profits that firms keep).</em></p>
        
        <h3>Personal Disposable Income (PDI)</h3>
        <p><strong>Personal Disposable Income</strong> is the income households have left *after* paying personal direct taxes (like income tax). This is the income they can actually <strong>spend or save</strong>.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            PDI = Personal Income - Personal Direct Taxes - Fines, Fees, etc.
        </span>
        <span class="formula">PDI = Consumption (C) + Saving (S)</span>
        
        <h3>Per Capita Income (PCI)</h3>
        <p><strong>Per Capita Income</strong> is the average income per person in the country. It is a rough measure of the standard of living.</p>
        <span class="formula">PCI = National Income (NNP_FC) / Total Population</span>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">Real and Nominal Personal Income</h2>
        <p>This concept applies to all income aggregates (GDP, GNP, Personal Income, etc.).</p>
        
        <h3>Nominal Income</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Income measured at <strong>current year prices</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Nominal income can increase just because of <em>inflation</em>, even if no real growth occurred.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Real Income</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Income measured at <strong>constant (base year) prices</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> This measures the actual *purchasing power* of income, as it has been adjusted for inflation. It is the best measure of economic growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="formula">
            Real Income = (Nominal Income / Price Index) × 100
        </span>
        <p>The <strong>Price Index</strong> used to convert nominal GDP to real GDP is called the <strong>GDP Deflator</strong>.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic4">Methods of Measuring National Income</h2>
        <p>There are three main methods to measure National Income (GDP), which should all give the same result:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Product Method (or Value Added Method)</h3>
        <p>This method sums up the <strong>value added</strong> by all producing firms in the economy. Value added is the market value of a firm's output minus the value of intermediate goods it purchased.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            Value Added = Value of Output - Intermediate Consumption
        </span>
        <span class="formula">
            GDP_MP = Sum of Gross Value Added by all firms in the economy
        </span>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> This method is the best way to avoid the problem of <strong>double counting</strong> (counting the value of the same good multiple times, e.g., counting the wheat, the flour, *and* the bread).
        </div>
        
        <h3>2. Income Method</h3>
        <p>This method sums up all the <strong>factor incomes</strong> earned by the factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship). This gives <strong>NDP_FC (Net Domestic Product at Factor Cost)</strong>.</p>
        <span class="formula">
            NDP_FC = Compensation of Employees + Operating Surplus + Mixed Income
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compensation of Employees (Labor):</strong> Wages, salaries, benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Operating Surplus (Capital/Land):</strong> Rent, Interest, and Profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Income:</strong> Income of self-employed individuals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To get to NI (NNP_FC) from here: <span class="formula">NI = NDP_FC + NFIA</span></p>
        
        <h3>3. Expenditure Method</h3>
        <p>This method sums up all the final <strong>spending</strong> on goods and services in the economy. This gives <strong>GDP_MP</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="formula">GDP_MP = C + I + G + (X - M)</span>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C (Private Final Consumption):</strong> Spending by households.</li>
            <li><strong>I (Gross Domestic Capital Formation):</strong> Investment spending by firms.</li>
            <li><strong>G (Government Final Consumption):</strong> Spending by the government on goods and services (<strong>Note:</strong> excludes transfer payments like pensions).</li>
            <li><strong>(X - M) (Net Exports):</strong> Exports minus Imports.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic5">Difficulties in Measuring National Income</h2>
        <p>Calculating an accurate NI figure is extremely difficult due to several conceptual and practical problems:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Problem of Double Counting:</strong> The risk of counting the value of intermediate goods multiple times. (Solved by the Value Added method).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Monetized Sector:</strong> In economies like India, many transactions are not in money (barter system) or are for self-consumption (e.g., a farmer growing food for his own family). This output is not counted.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Market Activities:</strong> GDP excludes a vast amount of valuable unpaid work.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> Services of a homemaker, DIY home repairs, volunteer work.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The "Black" or Informal Economy:</strong> Illegal activities (e.g., smuggling) and legal but unreported income (to avoid taxes) are not included, leading to underestimation.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Reliable Data:</strong> In many developing countries, data collection is poor, and records from small-scale producers are inaccurate or unavailable.</li>
            <li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Calculating the *true* value of depreciation (wear and tear) of capital is very difficult and often just an estimation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic6">National Income and Economic Welfare</h2>
        <p>Does a high or rising National Income (GDP) mean a high level of social welfare or well-being? <strong>Not necessarily.</strong> GDP is a flawed measure of welfare for many reasons:</p>
        
        <h3>Limitations of GDP as a measure of well-being:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Distribution of Income:</strong> A high GDP could be concentrated in the hands of a few (high inequality), so the average person may not be better off. A high Per Capita Income can hide this.</li>
            <li><strong>Composition of Output:</strong> GDP only measures *how much* is produced, not *what* is produced. A country that produces more weapons and a country that produces more schools could have the same GDP, but very different welfare levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Externalities (Negative):</strong> GDP can *increase* due to harmful activities.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> A factory pollutes a river (which isn't subtracted from GDP). Then, the government spends money to clean it up (which is *added* to GDP). GDP rises, but welfare has clearly fallen.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Leisure:</strong> GDP doesn't value leisure time. If everyone works 80 hours a week, GDP might soar, but well-being (welfare) would collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Market Activities:</strong> As mentioned before, GDP excludes valuable unpaid work (housework, childcare, volunteering) that contributes greatly to welfare.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> GDP is a good measure of economic <em>production</em>, but a poor measure of economic <em>welfare</em>.</p>

        <h2 id="topic7">Circular Flow of Income in Two Sector, Three Sector and Four Sector Economy</h2>
        <p><em>(This is a review and application of the concepts from Unit 4)</em></p>
        <p>The Circular Flow of Income model shows how income and spending flow between different sectors of the economy. It demonstrates the identity that <strong>Total Leakages must equal Total Injections</strong> for the economy to be in equilibrium.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leakages (Withdrawals):</strong> Money that *leaves* the central flow of spending.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Savings (S)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Taxes (T)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Imports (M)</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Injections (Additions):</strong> Money that is *added* to the central flow of spending.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Investment (I)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Government Spending (G)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Exports (X)</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Equilibrium Conditions:</h3>
