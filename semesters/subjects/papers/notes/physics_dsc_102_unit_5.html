        <h2 id="topic1">Classical Relativity (Frames of Reference, Galilean Invariance)</h2>
        
        <h3>Frame of Reference</h3>
        <p>A coordinate system used to measure positions and times of events. As seen in Unit 1, an <strong>Inertial Frame</strong> is one that is not accelerating (at rest or moving at constant velocity).</p>
        
        <h3>Galilean Transformations</h3>
        <p>This is the "common sense" set of equations for transforming measurements from one inertial frame (S) to another frame (S') that is moving with a constant velocity `v` along the x-axis relative to S.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>x' = x - vt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>y' = y</strong></li>
            <li><strong>z' = z</strong></li>
            <li><strong>t' = t</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last equation, <strong>t' = t</strong>, is the crucial assumption of classical physics: <strong>Time is absolute</strong>. Everyone measures the same time interval between two events.</p>
        
        <h3>Galilean Invariance</h3>
        <p>Galilean Invariance (or the Principle of Classical Relativity) states that <strong>the laws of mechanics are the same (invariant) in all inertial frames</strong>.
        <br>
        If you are in a smooth-moving train (inertial frame), you can play catch, and the ball will behave exactly as it would on the ground. You cannot perform any mechanical experiment *inside* the train to tell if you are moving or at rest.
        <br>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism (which predict the speed of light `c`) are *not* invariant under Galilean transformations. This implies the laws of E&M are *not* the same in all inertial frames, or that the Galilean transformations are wrong.
        </p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Michelson-Morley Experiment (1887)</h2>
        
        <h3>The "Luminiferous Ether" Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>In the 19th century, light was known to be a wave. Scientists assumed it *must* travel through a medium, just as sound waves travel through air. They called this invisible, all-pervading medium the <strong>"luminiferous ether"</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This ether was assumed to be stationary, forming an "absolute rest frame" in the universe.</li>
            <li>The Earth, in its orbit, must be moving *through* this ether at some speed `v`.</li>
            <li>This should create an "ether wind" (like the wind you feel on a bike).</li>
            <li>The measured speed of light `c` should be `c-v` (upstream) and `c+v` (downstream).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Experiment</h3>
        <p>Michelson and Morley used a very sensitive <strong>interferometer</strong> to detect this tiny difference in the speed of light.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A light beam is split in two.</li>
            <li>Beam 1 travels along an arm (L₁) parallel to the ether wind, and back.</li>
            <li>Beam 2 travels along an arm (L₂) perpendicular to the ether wind, and back.</li>
            <li>The two beams are recombined. The difference in their travel times should create a shift in the interference (fringe) pattern.</li>
            <li>They then <strong>rotated the entire apparatus by 90°</strong>. The roles of the arms would swap, and a <strong>shift in the fringe pattern</strong> was expected.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Outcome (The "Null Result")</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>No fringe shift was ever observed.</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The experiment was repeated at different times of day and year. The result was always <strong>null</strong> (zero).</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The speed of light is <strong>constant in all directions</strong>, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source. The idea of the luminiferous ether was wrong.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Postulates of Special Theory of Relativity (STR)</h2>
        <p>In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed a new theory based on two simple, radical postulates to explain the Michelson-Morley result and the E&M problem.</p>
        
        <h3>Postulate 1: The Principle of Relativity</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>"The laws of physics are the same (invariant) in all inertial frames of reference."</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This extends Galilean relativity to *all* laws of physics, including electromagnetism. There is no "absolute rest frame"; all inertial frames are equivalent.</p>
        
        <h3>Postulate 2: The Constancy of the Speed of Light</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>"The speed of light in a vacuum (c) has the same value for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer."</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This directly accepts the Michelson-Morley result. It is a radical break from "common sense" and Galilean transformations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> To make these postulates work together, the classical idea of <strong>absolute time (t' = t) must be abandoned</strong>. Time and space are now relative and interwoven into "spacetime".</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic4">Lorentz Transformations</h2>
        <p>These are the *new* set of transformation equations that replace the Galilean ones. They are derived directly from Einstein's two postulates. They preserve the laws of E&M and keep `c` constant.</p>
        <p>For frame S' moving at velocity `v` along the +x axis relative to frame S:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>x' = γ (x - vt)</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>y' = y</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>z' = z</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>t' = γ (t - vx/c²)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Where <strong>γ (gamma)</strong> is the <strong>Lorentz factor</strong>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Properties of γ:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If v = 0, then γ = 1.</li>
                <li>If v > 0, then γ > 1.</li>
                <li>If v << c (normal speeds), then v²/c² ≈ 0 and <strong>γ ≈ 1</strong>. In this case, the Lorentz transformations <strong>reduce to the Galilean transformations</strong> (t' ≈ t, x' ≈ x-vt). This is the <strong>correspondence principle</strong>.</li>
                <li>If v → c, then v²/c² → 1, and <strong>γ → ∞</strong>. This shows that `v=c` is a limiting speed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Inverse Transformations</strong> (from S' to S): Just swap (x, t) with (x', t') and change `v` to `-v`.</p>
        <p class="formula">x = γ (x' + vt')</p>
        <p class="formula">t = γ (t' + vx'/c²)</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic5">Simultaneity and Order of Events</h2>
        <p><strong>Relativity of Simultaneity:</strong> This is a direct consequence of the `t'` equation: `t' = γ (t - vx/c²)`.</p>
        <p>Consider two events (A and B) that happen at the same time `t` in frame S, but at different locations `x_A` and `x_B`.</p>
        <p>In frame S', the times of the events are:</p>
        <p>t'<sub>A</sub> = γ (t - vx<sub>A</sub>/c²)</p>
        <p>t'<sub>B</sub> = γ (t - vx<sub>B</sub>/c²)</p>
        <p>The time difference in S' is: Δt' = t'<sub>B</sub> - t'<sub>A</sub> = -γv(x<sub>B</sub> - x<sub>A</sub>)/c²</p>
        <p>Since `x_A ≠ x_B`, the time difference <strong>Δt' is not zero</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Events that are simultaneous in one frame (S) are NOT simultaneous in another frame (S') that is moving relative to it.</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Order of Events:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If two events are "timelike" separated (one can cause the other), their time order is preserved in all frames (causality is maintained).</li>
                <li>If two events are "spacelike" separated (one cannot cause the other, as a light signal can't connect them), their time order can be *reversed* in different frames.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic6">Lorentz Contraction (Length Contraction)</h2>
        <p>A moving object appears shorter in the direction of its motion.</p>
        <p>Consider a rod at rest in frame S'. Its "proper length" (length in its rest frame) is L₀ = x'₂ - x'₁.</p>
        <p>An observer in frame S wants to measure its length. They must measure the positions of its ends (x₁ and x₂) *at the same time* in their frame (t₁ = t₂ = t).</p>
        <p>Using the Lorentz transformation `x' = γ (x - vt)`:</p>
        <p>x'₂ = γ (x₂ - vt)</p>
        <p>x'₁ = γ (x₁ - vt)</p>
        <p>Subtracting the two equations: (x'₂ - x'₁) = γ (x₂ - x₁)</p>
        <p>L₀ = γ * L (where L is the length measured in S)</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>L = L₀ / γ = L₀ √(1 - v²/c²)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since γ ≥ 1, the measured length <strong>L is always less than L₀</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This contraction only happens <strong>parallel to the direction of motion</strong>.</li>
            <li>Perpendicular lengths (y and z) are unaffected.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic7">Time Dilation</h2>
        <p>A moving clock runs slow, as measured by a stationary observer.</p>
        <p>Consider a clock at rest in frame S'. It ticks at one location (x'₁ = x'₂ = x'). The time interval between two ticks *in its rest frame* is the "proper time", Δt₀ = t'₂ - t'₁.</p>
        <p>An observer in S measures this time interval using their own clock. They use the inverse transformation `t = γ (t' + vx'/c²)`:</p>
        <p>t₂ = γ (t'₂ + vx'/c²)</p>
        <p>t₁ = γ (t'₁ + vx'/c²)</p>
        <p>Subtracting the equations: (t₂ - t₁) = γ (t'₂ - t'₁)</p>
        <p>Let Δt = t₂ - t₁ (the time interval measured by S, the "moving" observer).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Δt = γ Δt₀ = Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since γ ≥ 1, the measured time interval <strong>Δt is always greater than Δt₀</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>In words:</strong> The observer in S sees the S' clock (which ticks once every Δt₀ seconds) taking a longer time Δt to complete one tick. The moving clock appears to run slow.</p>

        <h3>Experimental Verification</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Hafele-Keating Experiment (1971):</strong> Atomic clocks were flown on commercial jets around the world. When compared to a reference clock on the ground, the moving clocks ran slightly slower, exactly as predicted by relativity (after accounting for General Relativity effects as well).</li>
            <li><strong>Muon Decay:</strong> Muons are unstable particles created in the upper atmosphere. They have a very short proper lifetime (Δt₀ ≈ 2.2 μs). They travel at ~0.99c.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classically:</strong> They should only travel `d = v*Δt₀ ≈ (3e8)(2.2e-6) ≈ 660 m` before decaying. They should not reach the Earth's surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relativistically (from Earth's frame):</strong> We see the muon's clock running slow. Its lifetime in *our* frame is `Δt = γΔt₀`. For v=0.99c, γ ≈ 7.1. So, `Δt ≈ 7.1 * 2.2 μs ≈ 15.6 μs`.
                        <br>In this time, it *can* travel `d = v*Δt ≈ (0.99c)(15.6e-6) ≈ 4600 m`.
                    </li>
                    <li>We detect muons on the ground, which is direct proof of time dilation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic8">Twin Paradox</h2>
        <p>This is a thought experiment that highlights the non-intuitive nature of time dilation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Twin A stays on Earth (inertial frame). Twin B takes a rocket on a high-speed round trip to a distant star (v ≈ c).</li>
            <li><strong>The "Paradox":</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Twin A (Earth): Sees Twin B's clock (in the rocket) running slow (Δt = γΔt₀). So, when B returns, A will be much older than B.</li>
                    <li>Twin B (Rocket): From B's perspective, *Earth* is the one moving away. So B should see A's clock running slow, and B should be older.</li>
                </ul>
                This is a contradiction. Who is *really* younger?
            </li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The "paradox" is resolved by noting that the situation is <strong>not symmetric</strong>.
                <br>Twin A (Earth) stays in a <strong>single inertial frame</strong> the whole time.

        <h2 id="topic9">Relativistic Addition of Velocities</h2>
        <p>This formula replaces the simple Galilean `v_total = u + v`.</p>
        <p>Let frame S see an object moving with velocity `u_x`.
        <br>Let frame S' move with velocity `v` relative to S (along x-axis).
        <br>What velocity `u_x'` does S' measure for the object?</p>
        
        <p>Derive from Lorentz transformations: `x' = γ(x-vt)` and `t' = γ(t-vx/c²)`.</p>
        <p>u_x' = dx'/dt' = [γ(dx - v dt)] / [γ(dt - v dx/c²)] = (dx/dt - v) / (1 - (v/c²)(dx/dt))</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>u_x' = (u_x - v) / (1 - u_x v / c²)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The inverse (what S sees) is more common:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>u_x = (u_x' + v) / (1 + u_x' v / c²)</strong>

            <strong>Key Consequence (Test with light):</strong>
            <br>
            If S' (a rocket) fires a laser beam `u_x' = c` while moving at `v = 0.9c`. What speed `u_x` does S (Earth) see for the laser beam?
            <br>
            Classically: u_x = c + 0.9c = 1.9c (Impossible!)
            <br>
            Relativistically: u_x = (c + v) / (1 + cv/c²) = (c+v) / (1 + v/c)
            <br>u_x = c(1 + v/c) / (1 + v/c) = <strong>c</strong>.
            <br>
            The formula correctly ensures that *all* observers measure the speed of light to be `c`, upholding Postulate 2.

        <h2 id="topic10">Variation of Mass with Velocity (Relativistic Mass)</h2>
        <p>(Note: The modern concept is that mass `m` is invariant, and relativistic momentum is `p = γmv`. The "relativistic mass" `m_rel = γm` is an older, but still common, way to teach this.)</p>
        <p>To conserve momentum in relativity, the definition of momentum must be changed. This is equivalent to saying that mass increases with velocity.</p>
        <p>Let `m₀` be the <strong>rest mass</strong> (mass of the object in its rest frame).</p>
        <p>The mass `m(v)` when it is moving at speed `v` is:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>m(v) = γ m₀ = m₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>As `v → c`, `γ → ∞`, and the object's mass `m(v) → ∞`.</li>
            <li>This means an infinite force (and infinite energy) would be required to accelerate a massive object to the speed of light.</li>
            <li>This is why <strong>no object with mass can ever reach the speed of light</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic11">Massless Particles</h2>
        <p>What about particles that *do* travel at `v = c`, like photons (particles of light)?</p>
        <p>If `v = c`, the mass equation is `m(c) = m₀ / √(1 - c²/c²) = m₀ / 0`.</p>
        <p>For this to be non-infinite, the *only* possibility is that the <strong>rest mass m₀ must be zero</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A particle with <strong>m₀ = 0</strong> (a massless particle) *must* travel at `v = c` in all frames.</li>
            <li>A particle with <strong>m₀ > 0</strong> (a massive particle) *must* travel at `v < c` in all frames.</li>

        <h2 id="topic12">Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²)</h2>
        <p>This is the most famous equation in physics. It is a direct consequence of STR.</p>
        <p><strong>Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):</strong></p>
        <p>K = (Work done) = ∫ F dx = ∫ (dp/dt) dx = ... (a complex derivation)</p>
        <p>The result is: <strong>K = (γ - 1) m₀c²</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Total Relativistic Energy (E):</strong></p>
        <p>E = K + (Rest Energy)</p>
        <p>E = (γ - 1)m₀c² + m₀c²</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>E = γ m₀c² = m(v) c²</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is the full equation. It combines the kinetic energy and the rest energy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rest Energy (E₀):</strong></p>
        <p>If the particle is at rest (v=0, γ=1), its total energy is:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>E₀ = m₀c²</strong>
            </blockquote>
        <p>This is the profound conclusion: <strong>Mass is a form of energy</strong>. A particle at rest has an "in-built" energy content equal to its rest mass times c².</p>
        <p>This explains the energy released in:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Fission:</strong> A heavy nucleus (Uranium) splits into lighter nuclei. The *total rest mass* of the products is *less* than the original mass. This "lost mass" (Δm) is converted into a huge amount of kinetic energy: E = (Δm)c².</li>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Fusion:</strong> Light nuclei (Hydrogen) fuse to form a heavier nucleus (Helium). Again, the final rest mass is less than the sum of the initial masses, releasing energy (this powers the Sun).</li>
