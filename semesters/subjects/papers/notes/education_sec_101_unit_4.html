            This unit is practical. The notes below describe the techniques and their benefits. <strong>Warning:</strong> These practices, especially complex pranayamas and kriyas, should be learned from a qualified instructor.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic1">1. Participating in any five Asanas</h2>
        <p>The syllabus requires participation in <strong>five</strong> of the listed asanas. Here are detailed descriptions of some of the most common and important ones from the list.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Shavasana (Corpse Pose)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Perform:</strong> Lie flat on your back with legs slightly apart and arms by your sides, palms facing up. Close your eyes and consciously relax every part of your body, from your toes to your head. Breathe normally.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> This is the ultimate relaxation pose. It calms the central nervous system, relieves stress and fatigue, and helps the body "digest" the effects of the other asanas. It is typically performed at the end of every yoga session.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Perform:</strong> Lie on your stomach with your forehead on the floor and palms under your shoulders. Inhale and lift your head, chest, and abdomen off the floor, using your back muscles. Keep your navel on the floor.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Strengthens the spine, opens the chest and shoulders, and improves lung capacity. It is excellent for relieving back pain and stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Perform:</strong> Sit with your legs stretched out in front of you. Inhale and lengthen your spine. Exhale and hinge from your hips, folding forward over your legs. Hold your shins, ankles, or feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Provides a deep stretch for the entire back of the body (spine and hamstrings). It calms the brain, relieves anxiety, and aids digestion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Perform:</strong> Lie on your back. Inhale and lift your legs and hips off the floor, bringing your torso perpendicular to the floor. Support your back with your hands. Rest your weight on your shoulders and upper arms (not your neck).</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Known as the "Queen of Asanas" for its many benefits. It stimulates the thyroid gland, improves circulation to the brain, and calms the nervous system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Vajrasana (Thunderbolt or Diamond Pose)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Perform:</strong> Kneel on the floor, then sit back on your heels, with your spine, neck, and head straight. Rest your palms on your thighs.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> This is one of the only asanas that can be performed <strong>immediately after a meal</strong>. It is excellent for digestion and can also be a comfortable sitting posture for pranayama.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Padmasana (Lotus Pose)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Perform:</strong> A cross-legged sitting posture. Sit on the floor, place the right foot on the left thigh, and the left foot on the right thigh, with soles facing up.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> The "classic" meditation posture. It creates a very stable base, keeps the spine straight, and calms the mind, making it ideal for deep meditation and pranayama.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Participation in Pranayamas and Kriyas</h2>
        <p>This section covers breathing techniques (Pranayamas) and cleansing techniques (Kriyas).</p>
        
        <h3>Pranayamas (Breathing Techniques)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anulom-Vilom (Alternate Nostril Breathing):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Use the right thumb to close the right nostril. Inhale slowly through the left nostril. Close the left nostril with the ring finger, open the right, and exhale slowly. Then, inhale through the right nostril, close it, and exhale through the left. This is one round.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> <span id="spap_4">Purifies the energy channels (nadis) and balances the left and right hemispheres of the brain.</span> It is extremely effective for calming the mind and reducing anxiety.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bhramari (Bee Breath):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Close your eyes. Inhale deeply. While exhaling, make a low-pitched humming sound, like a bee, for the entire duration of the exhale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Instantly calms the mind, relieves tension and anger, and is excellent for meditation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sitali (Cooling Breath):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Curl the tongue into a tube. Inhale slowly through the curled tongue (it will feel cool). Close the mouth and exhale slowly through the nose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Cools the body and the mind. It is very useful for reducing body heat, stress, and anxiety.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ujjayi (Victorious Breath):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Gently constrict the back of the throat (the glottis) and breathe in and out through the nose. This creates a soft, audible "ocean sound" or "snoring" sound.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Builds internal heat, focuses the mind, and is often used during asana practice to link breath with movement.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Kriyas (Cleansing Techniques)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neti (Nasal Cleansing):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> This is most commonly <em>Jala Neti</em>. A special "neti pot" is used to pour warm saline (salty) water into one nostril. The water flows through the nasal passages and comes out the other nostril.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses the nasal passages of mucus, pollen, and pollutants. It is very effective for allergies, sinus problems, and colds.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Kapalbhati (Skull Shining Breath):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> This is a kriya, not a pranayama. It consists of a series of <strong>forceful, active exhales</strong> and <strong>passive, automatic inhales</strong>. The focus is on pumping the abdomen to push the air out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses the respiratory system, energizes the entire body and mind, and tones the abdominal muscles.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Participation in Art of Living skills (To be Organised by a Trained Person)</h2>
        
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>This syllabus entry refers to the techniques taught by the <strong>"Art of Living"</strong> foundation, founded by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. As the syllabus states, these must be learned from a trained instructor and not from a book or website.</p>
        
        <h3>Core Skills and Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sudarshan Kriya:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the central technique of the Art of Living. It is a unique and powerful <strong>rhythmic breathing process</strong>.</li>
                    <li>It uses specific, cyclical breathing patterns to calm the nervous system, eliminate deep-seated stress, and purify the entire system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other Skills Taught:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Practical Wisdom:</strong> The courses include simple yet profound "life skills" (similar to Unit 3) for handling the mind, emotions, and daily challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Guided meditations are taught to further calm the mind.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light Yoga:</strong> Simple asanas are included to prepare the body for the breathing techniques.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> For an exam, you are not expected to *teach* this technique. You should be able to <strong>identify Sudarshan Kriya as the core component</strong> of the "Art of Living skills" and explain that it is a specialized rhythmic breathing technique for stress relief and holistic health, which must be learned from a certified trainer.
