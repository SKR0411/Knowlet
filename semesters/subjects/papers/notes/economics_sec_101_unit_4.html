        <h2 id="topic1">Role of government in promoting entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p>No entrepreneur can succeed in a vacuum. They require a supportive "ecosystem." The government plays the most critical role in creating this ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The government's role is not to run businesses, but to act as a <strong>facilitator</strong> and <strong>regulator</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Formulation:</strong> Creating policies that encourage new ventures (e.g., tax holidays, simplified regulations).</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Support:</strong> Providing capital through government banks, loan guarantee schemes, and subsidies.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructural Support:</strong> Building roads, ensuring power supply, and creating "industrial estates" or "incubation centers" where new businesses can get plug-and-play facilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Training and Development:</strong> Establishing institutions (like NIESBUD) to provide entrepreneurship training and skill development.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing Support:</strong> Helping SSIs and Start-ups sell their products, both domestically and internationally (e.g., through trade fairs, government procurement).</li>
            <li><strong>Simplified Regulation:</strong> Reducing "red tape" and creating a "single-window" system for approvals to make it easier to start and run a business.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic2">Start up India</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Start up India</strong> is a flagship initiative launched by the Government of India in 2016. Its primary objective is to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship in the country.
        </blockquote>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funding Support and Incentives:</strong>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Industry-Academia Partnership and Incubation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a network of <strong>incubation centers</strong> and "tinkering labs" in universities to provide physical space, mentorship, and resources to new ideas.</li>
