        <h2 id="topic1">Population Concepts</h2>

        <h3 id="sub1_1">Population and Meta-population</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Population (Definition):</strong> A population is a group of individuals of the <strong>same species</strong> that live in the <strong>same geographic area</strong> at the <strong>same time</strong>, and have the capability of interbreeding.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ecology at the population level studies how population size, density, and composition change over time and in different locations.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Meta-population (Definition):</strong> A meta-population is a "population of populations." It is a group of spatially separated populations of the same species that interact at some level (i.e., individuals move between them).
        </blockquote>
        <p>This concept was developed by <strong>Richard Levins</strong>. Imagine a group of islands, each with its own small population of butterflies. These populations are separate, but occasionally a butterfly from one island flies to another. This entire network of island populations is a meta-population.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patches:</strong> The individual habitat areas occupied by a population.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration/Dispersal:</strong> The movement of individuals between patches. This is key for "rescuing" small populations from extinction (the <strong>rescue effect</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamics:</strong> The meta-population is stable if the rate of colonization of empty patches is greater than or equal to the rate of extinction of existing populations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="sub1_2">r- and K-selection</h3>
        <p>This is a theory about life history strategies, describing two "extremes" of how organisms allocate resources to reproduction and survival. This concept relates directly to the logistic growth model (see <a href="#sub3_3">Logistic Growth</a>).</p>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Important Point:</strong> r- and K-selection is a <strong>spectrum</strong>, not a binary choice. Most organisms fall somewhere in the middle. A sea turtle, for example, is K-selected (long life, late maturity) but also r-selected (lays many eggs with no parental care).
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic2">Characteristics of Population</h2>
        <p>Populations have unique characteristics that individuals do not, such as density, age structure, and growth rate.</p>

        <h3 id="sub2_1">Population Density</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Population density is the number of individuals of a species per unit area or volume.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crude Density:</strong> Number of individuals per <em>total</em> unit of area. (e.g., 100 deer per 10 square km).</li>
            <li><strong>Ecological Density:</strong> Number of individuals per unit of <em>habitat space</em> (the area actually usable by the species). (e.g., 100 deer per 5 square km of forest, if the other 5 km is a lake they don't use).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Measurement Techniques:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Direct Count (Census):</strong> Counting every individual. Only feasible for large, easily seen organisms in a small area (e.g., counting elephants from a plane).</li>
            <li><strong>Sampling (Quadrat Method):</strong> Used for plants and slow-moving animals. A frame of a known size (e.g., 1m x 1m) called a quadrat is placed randomly. Individuals inside are counted, and the number is extrapolated to the whole area.</li>
            <li><strong>Mark-Recapture Method:</strong> Used for mobile animals (fish, birds, butterflies).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Capture a sample (M) individuals, mark them, and release.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> After some time, capture a second sample (n).</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Count how many in the second sample are marked (m).</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Estimate total population (N) using the Lincoln-Petersen Index:</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="formula">
                    N = (M * n) / m
                    <br>
                    (Total Population = (Marked in sample 1 * Total in sample 2) / Recaptured in sample 2)
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="sub2_2">Natality and Mortality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natality (Birth Rate):</strong> The production of new individuals in a population over a period of time.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crude Natality:</strong> Number of births per unit time (e.g., 500 births per year).</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific Natality:</strong> Number of births per unit time per individual (e.g., 0.5 births per female per year).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mortality (Death Rate):</strong> The number of individuals dying in a population over a period of time.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crude Mortality:</strong> Number of deaths per unit time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific Mortality:</strong> Number of deaths per unit time per individual.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Survivorship Curves:</strong> A graph showing the number of surviving individuals over time, from a cohort (group of individuals born at the same time).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type I (Convex):</strong> High survival through early and middle life, followed by a rapid decline in old age. (e.g., Humans, elephants - K-selected).</li>
            <li><strong>Type II (Diagonal):</strong> Constant mortality rate regardless of age. (e.g., Many birds, lizards, hydra).</li>
            <li><strong>Type III (Concave):</strong> Very high mortality for the young, but high survival for those who make it to adulthood. (e.g., Oysters, fish, insects, trees - r-selected).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub2_3">Age Structure</h3>
        <p>The distribution of individuals among different age classes in a population. This is often visualized using an <strong>Age Pyramid</strong>, which plots the percentage of the population in pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive age groups.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Expanding/Growing Population:</strong> A pyramid with a wide base and narrow top. Many young individuals, high birth rate. (e.g., India, Nigeria).</li>
            <li><strong>Stable/Stationary Population:</strong> A "beehive" or bell shape. Pre-reproductive and reproductive groups are roughly equal. (e.g., Sweden, France).</li>
            <li><strong>Declining/Diminishing Population:</strong> An "urn" shape with a narrow base. Fewer young individuals than reproductive individuals. (e.g., Japan, Germany).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Age structure is a crucial predictor of future population growth.</p>

        <h2 id="topic3">Population Growth</h2>
        <p>Population size changes based on four factors: Births (B), Deaths (D), Immigration (I), and Emigration (E).
        <br><strong>Change in N = (B + I) - (D + E)</strong></p>
        <p>For simplified models, we often ignore I and E and focus on births and deaths. The <strong>intrinsic rate of natural increase (r)</strong> is defined as <strong>r = b - d</strong> (per-capita birth rate minus per-capita death rate).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If r > 0, the population is growing.</li>
            <li>If r < 0, the population is shrinking.</li>
            <li>If r = 0, the population is stable (Zero Population Growth).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub3_1">Geometric Growth</h3>
        <p>This model applies to populations with <strong>discrete breeding seasons</strong> (e.g., deer that mate once a year, annual plants). Growth is measured in "steps."</p>
        <div class="formula">
            N(t) = N(0) * &lambda;<sup>t</sup>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>N(t)</strong> = Population size at time t</li>
            <li><strong>N(0)</strong> = Initial population size at time 0</li>
            <li><strong>&lambda;</strong> (lambda) = Geometric rate of increase (ratio of population size in one year to the previous year).</li>
            <li><strong>t</strong> = Number of discrete time intervals (e.g., years)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="sub3_2">Exponential Growth (J-shaped curve)</h3>
        <p>This model applies to populations with <strong>continuous breeding</strong> (e.g., bacteria, humans) living in an <strong>unlimited environment</strong> (infinite resources, no predators).</p>
        <p>The rate of change in the population (dN/dt) is proportional to the population size (N) and the intrinsic rate of increase (r).</p>
        <div class="formula">
            dN/dt = rN
        </div>
        <p>The resulting growth curve is <strong>J-shaped</strong>. Population growth starts slow but accelerates rapidly as the population base gets larger. This type of growth is unsustainable in the real world.</p>
        <h3 id="sub3_3">Logistic Growth (S-shaped curve)</h3>
        <p>This is a more realistic model that incorporates <strong>environmental limits</strong>. As the population grows, resources become scarce, and growth slows down. The maximum population size an environment can sustainably support is called the <strong>Carrying Capacity (K)</strong>.</p>
        <p>The logistic model modifies the exponential model by adding a "braking" term: <strong>(K-N)/K</strong>.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            dN/dt = rN * ( (K - N) / K )
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>When N is very small (much less than K), the term (K-N)/K is close to 1, and growth is almost exponential (dN/dt &approx; rN).</li>
            <li>When N approaches K, the term (K-N)/K approaches 0, and growth stops (dN/dt &approx; 0).</li>
            <li>If N > K, the term is negative, and the population shrinks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The resulting growth curve is <strong>S-shaped (sigmoid)</strong>. Growth is fastest when the population is at <strong>K/2</strong> (half the carrying capacity). This point is called the maximum sustainable yield.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Question Alert:</strong> Be prepared to draw, label, and compare the J-shaped and S-shaped growth curves. Understand what each variable (N, r, K, t) represents in the logistic and exponential equations.

        <h2 id="topic4">Limits to Population Growth</h2>
        <p>These are the environmental factors that stop a population from growing exponentially forever. The syllabus only lists "density-dependent" factors, but it's crucial to know both types.</p>

        <h3 id="sub4_1">Density-dependent Factors</h3>
        <p>Factors whose limiting effect becomes <strong>stronger as population density increases</strong>. These are usually <strong>biotic</strong> factors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Competition (Intraspecific):</strong> Individuals of the same species compete for limited resources (food, water, mates, territory). More individuals = more intense competition.</li>
            <li><strong>Predation:</strong> Predators may be attracted to areas of high prey density, increasing the mortality rate of the prey.</li>
            <li><strong>Disease and Parasitism:</strong> Diseases spread more easily in dense populations.</li>
            <li><strong>Toxic Waste Accumulation:</strong> (e.g., yeast in a wine vat die from their own alcohol waste as their population density increases).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Density-dependent factors are what "push" a population towards its carrying capacity (K) in the logistic model.</p>
        
        <h3 id="sub4_2">Density-independent Factors (Implied)</h3>
        <p>Though not explicitly listed, understanding these is key. These factors limit a population's size <strong>regardless of its density</strong>. These are usually <strong>abiotic</strong> factors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> A hurricane, drought, flood, or cold snap can kill individuals without regard for how crowded the population is.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Volcanic eruptions, fires, earthquakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Activities:</strong> Pollution, habitat destruction (e.g., building a dam).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These factors often cause sudden "crashes" in population, rather than a gradual leveling off.</p>
