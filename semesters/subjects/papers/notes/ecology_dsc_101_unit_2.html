            <h2>1. Population and Meta-population</h2>
            
            <h3>Concept of Population</h3>
            <p>A <strong>population</strong> is a group of individuals of the <strong>same species</strong> that live in the same geographical area at the same time and are capable of interbreeding. Population ecology studies how and why the number of individuals in a population changes over time.</p>

            <h3>Concept of Meta-population</h3>
            <p>A <strong>meta-population</strong> is a "population of populations." It's a group of spatially separated populations of the same species that are connected by occasional dispersal (migration of individuals) between them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The individual populations within the meta-population are called <strong>sub-populations</strong> or <strong>local populations</strong>.</li>
                <li>These sub-populations may go extinct over time, but the "empty" habitat patch can be <strong>re-colonized</strong> by individuals from other sub-populations.</li>
                <li>This dynamic of extinction and re-colonization allows the meta-population as a whole to persist, even if individual sub-populations do not.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A map showing several "habitat patches" (circles). Some are filled (occupied populations), some are empty. Arrows between the patches indicate "dispersal" or "colonization." One filled patch is shown fading to show "local extinction."
            </div>
            <p>This concept is crucial in conservation biology for managing species that live in fragmented habitats.</p>

        <section id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of a Population</h2>
            <p>Populations have unique characteristics that individuals do not. These are group attributes.</p>
            
            <h3>Population Density</h3>
            <p>This is the number of individuals per unit area or volume.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Density (D) = Number of individuals (N) / Unit of space (S)</strong>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crude Density:</strong> Number of individuals per total unit of space.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Density:</strong> Number of individuals per unit of <em>habitat space</em> (the area actually usable by the species).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Natality (Birth Rate)</h3>
            <p>The rate at which new individuals are produced in a population through birth, hatching, germination, etc.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crude Birth Rate:</strong> Number of births per 1000 individuals per year.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Birth Rate:</strong> Number of births per female of a specific age group.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mortality (Death Rate)</h3>
            <p>The rate at which individuals die in a population.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crude Death Rate:</strong> Number of deaths per 1000 individuals per year.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Death Rate:</strong> Number of deaths for a specific age group.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Age Structure</h3>
            <p>The distribution of individuals in a population among different age classes. This is often visualized using an <strong>age pyramid</strong>. The age structure is critical for predicting future population growth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-reproductive:</strong> Young individuals not yet capable of reproduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Reproductive:</strong> Individuals capable of reproduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-reproductive:</strong> Older individuals past their reproductive years.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> Three age pyramids.
                <br>1. <strong>Expanding (Rapid Growth):</strong> Wide base (many pre-reproductive), narrow top. (e.g., India, Nigeria).
                <br>2. <strong>Stable (Slow/Zero Growth):</strong> Rectangular shape, with pre-reproductive and reproductive groups nearly equal. (e.g., USA, France).
                <br>3. <strong>Declining (Negative Growth):</strong> Narrow base (few pre-reproductive), wider top. (e.g., Japan, Germany).

            <h2>3. Survivorship Curves</h2>
            <p>A survivorship curve is a graph that shows the pattern of mortality (death) in a population. It plots the number of surviving individuals (on a log scale) against their age.</p>
            <p>There are three main types:</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A graph with "Age" on the x-axis and "Log Number of Survivors" on the y-axis.
                <br>1. <strong>Type I (Convex):</strong> Line starts high, stays high, then drops sharply at old age.
                <br>2. <strong>Type II (Diagonal):</strong> Line is a straight, constant downward slope.
                <br>3. <strong>Type III (Concave):</strong> Line drops sharply at a young age, then flattens out.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type I (Late Loss):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Description:</strong> High survival rate throughout most of the lifespan, followed by heavy mortality in old age.</li>
                        <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Organisms typically produce few offspring but provide extensive parental care.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Humans, elephants, whales (large mammals).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Type II (Constant Loss):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Description:</strong> A constant mortality rate regardless of age. The chance of dying is equal at all ages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Often seen in organisms subject to random predation or environmental hazards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Many birds (e.g., robins), rodents, some lizards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Type III (Early Loss):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Extremely high mortality rate for the very young, but those that survive to a certain age have a high survival rate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Organisms typically produce a vast number of offspring with little to no parental care.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Oysters, sea turtles, fish, most insects, most plants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be able to draw all three curves, label the axes (log scale is important!), and provide a clear example for each type. Connect Type I to K-selection and Type III to r-selection (see section 6).

        <section id="growth">
            <h2>4. Population Growth Models</h2>
            <p>These are mathematical models that describe how a population's size changes over time.</p>
            
            <h3>Geometric Growth</h3>
            <p>This model describes growth in populations that have <strong>discrete, non-overlapping breeding seasons</strong> (e.g., annual plants, insects that breed once a year). The population grows in steps.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Formula: N(t) = N(0) * λᵗ</strong>
                <br>Where:
                <br><strong>N(t)</strong> = Population size at time 't'
                <br><strong>N(0)</strong> = Initial population size at time 0
                <br><strong>λ</strong> (lambda) = Geometric rate of increase (the fixed ratio of population size from one generation to the next)
                <br><strong>t</strong> = Number of discrete time intervals or generations
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Exponential Growth (J-shaped curve)</h3>
            <p>This model describes growth in populations that reproduce continuously (overlapping generations) in an <strong>unlimited environment</strong>. There are no limiting factors.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Formula: dN/dt = rN</strong>
                <br>Where:
                <br><strong>dN/dt</strong> = The rate of change in population size over time
                <br><strong>r</strong> = Intrinsic rate of natural increase (per capita growth rate: births - deaths)
                <br><strong>N</strong> = Population size
            </blockquote>
            <p>This model results in a <strong>J-shaped curve</strong>. Population growth starts slow but then accelerates rapidly as the population size (N) increases. This type of growth cannot be sustained indefinitely in the real world.</p>

            <h3>Logistic Growth (S-shaped curve)</h3>
            <p>This is a more realistic model that incorporates <strong>limiting factors</strong> and the concept of <strong>carrying capacity (K)</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Carrying Capacity (K):</strong> The maximum population size that an environment can sustainably support over a long period, given the available resources.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Formula: dN/dt = rN * ( (K - N) / K )</strong>
                <br>Where:
                <br><strong>(K - N) / K</strong> = The "logistic term" or "environmental resistance."
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>When <strong>N is very small</strong> (much less than K), (K-N)/K is close to 1. The equation becomes dN/dt = rN (exponential growth).</li>
                <li>When <strong>N approaches K</strong>, (K-N)/K approaches 0. The growth rate (dN/dt) slows down to zero.</li>
                <li>If <strong>N exceeds K</strong>, (K-N)/K becomes negative, and the population declines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This model results in a <strong>sigmoid or S-shaped curve</strong>, where the population grows, slows, and then stabilizes at the carrying capacity (K).</p>

            <div class="diagram-placeholder">
                <strong>Diagram:</strong> A graph with "Time" (x-axis) and "Population Size (N)" (y-axis).
                <br>1. <strong>J-shaped curve (Exponential):</strong> Starts low and curves up sharply, heading towards infinity.
                <br>2. <strong>S-shaped curve (Logistic):</strong> Starts low, curves up, then levels off at a horizontal line labeled "K (Carrying Capacity)".

        <section id="regulation">
            <h2>5. Population Regulation</h2>
            <p>Population growth is limited by various factors. These "limits to population growth" are what cause the logistic (S-shaped) curve instead of the exponential (J-shaped) curve.</p>
            
            <h3>Density-Dependent Factors</h3>
            <p>These are limiting factors whose effect on the population <strong>varies with population density</strong>. They become more intense as the population size increases.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competition (Intraspecific):</strong> Individuals of the same species compete for limited resources (food, water, mates, territory). As density increases, competition intensifies, slowing growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Predation:</strong> As prey population density increases, they become an easier and more abundant food source, attracting more predators.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease and Parasitism:</strong> Diseases and parasites spread more easily and rapidly in dense populations.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Accumulation:</strong> High population densities can lead to the buildup of toxic waste products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Density-dependent factors are <em>biotic</em> and are the main drivers of population regulation, leading to the carrying capacity (K).</p>

            <h3>Density-Independent Factors</h3>
            <p>These are limiting factors that affect a population <strong>regardless of its density</strong>. Their impact is not related to population size.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate and Weather:</strong> Events like droughts, floods, extreme temperatures, or hurricanes can kill individuals irrespective of how crowded the population is.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Activities:</strong> Pollution, deforestation, or the use of pesticides.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Density-independent factors are typically <em>abiotic</em> and can cause sudden population crashes, but they do not "regulate" a population around K in the same way.</p>

            <h2>6. Life History Strategies (r- and K-selection)</h2>
            <p>This is a theory that describes two main strategies organisms use to maximize their reproductive success (fitness). These strategies exist on a continuum.</p>

            <h3>r-Selected Species</h3>
            <p>These species are adapted for <strong>rapid population growth</strong> in unstable or unpredictable environments. Their strategy is to produce many offspring quickly.</p>

                <li>Their population size is often limited by <strong>density-independent</strong> factors (e.g., a sudden frost) and rarely reaches K.</li>
                <li>They are associated with the <strong>'r'</strong> (intrinsic rate of increase) from the growth equations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>K-Selected Species</h3>
            <p>These species are adapted for survival in <strong>stable, predictable environments</strong> where the population is at or near the <strong>carrying capacity (K)</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their population size is limited by <strong>density-dependent</strong> factors (e.g., competition).</li>
                <li>Their strategy is to produce fewer, "higher quality" offspring and invest heavily in them to ensure their survival.</li>
            </ul>
