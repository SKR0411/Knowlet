        <h2 id="topic1">The Human Eye and Vision</h2>
        
        <h3>Working of a human eye</h3>
        <p>The human eye works very much like a digital camera, capturing light and converting it into electrical signals for the brain.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cornea:</strong> The transparent outer layer at the front. It does most of the <strong>focusing</strong> (refraction) of light.</li>
            <li><strong>Iris & Pupil:</strong> The <strong>iris</strong> is the coloured part (e.g., blue, brown). It is a muscle that controls the size of the <strong>pupil</strong> (the black hole in the center).
                <ul>
                    <li>In bright light, the iris closes the pupil to reduce the amount of light entering.</li>
                    <li>In dim light, the iris opens the pupil to let more light in.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lens:</strong> A flexible, transparent structure located behind the iris. Its job is <strong>fine-tuning the focus</strong>. Muscles attached to the lens (ciliary muscles) can change its shape:
                <ul>
                    <li>To see <strong>distant</strong> objects: The lens becomes thinner and flatter.</li>
                    <li>To see <strong>nearby</strong> objects: The lens becomes thicker and more curved (this is called <strong>accommodation</strong>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Retina:</strong> The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, like the sensor in a camera. It contains millions of photoreceptor cells:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rods:</strong> Highly sensitive to light, used for night vision and detecting motion. They do not see colour.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cones:</strong> Less sensitive, but used for seeing <strong>colour</strong> and fine detail. They work best in bright light.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Optic Nerve:</strong> The photoreceptors convert the light image into electrical signals, which are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain then interprets these signals as "vision."</li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic2">Vision Defects and Concept of Colour</h2>
        
        <h3>Vision Defects</h3>
        <p>A "normal" eye can focus light from distant objects perfectly onto the retina when the lens is relaxed. Common defects occur when this focusing is incorrect.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Myopia (Nearsightedness):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptom:</strong> Can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects are blurry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> The eye is too long, or the lens/cornea is too curved. Light from distant objects is focused *in front of* the retina.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> A <strong>concave (diverging) lens</strong> is used in glasses to spread the light out slightly before it enters the eye, pushing the focal point back onto the retina.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hypermetropia (Farsightedness):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptom:</strong> Can see distant objects clearly, but has to strain to see nearby objects (or they are blurry).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> The eye is too short, or the lens/cornea is not curved enough. Light from nearby objects is focused *behind* the retina.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> A <strong>convex (converging) lens</strong> is used to bend the light more, pulling the focal point forward onto the retina.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Presbyopia:</strong> This is "age-related farsightedness." As people age, the lens loses its flexibility and cannot become thick enough to focus on close objects. The correction is the same as hypermetropia (a convex lens), often in the form of "reading glasses."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Concept of Colour</h3>
        <p>"White" light (like from the sun) is actually a mixture of all visible colours. This can be seen in a rainbow or when light passes through a prism, splitting into a <strong>spectrum</strong> (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet).</p>
        <p>An object's colour is determined by the wavelengths of light it <strong>reflects</strong>.
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>red</strong> apple appears red because its surface <strong>absorbs</strong> all colours *except* red, which it <strong>reflects</strong> to your eye.</li>
            <li>A <strong>white</strong> sheet of paper reflects *all* colours.</li>
            <li>A <strong>black</strong> object absorbs *all* colours (which is why it gets hotter in the sun).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the retina, we have three types of <strong>cone cells</strong>, each most sensitive to a different wavelength:
        <br><strong>(L) Red, (M) Green, and (S) Blue.</strong>
        <br>Your brain creates all the colours you see by mixing and comparing the strength of the signals from these three cone types. (This is the "RGB model" used in TVs and monitors).</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic3">Radiation and Rays</h2>
        <p><strong>Radiation</strong> is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or a material medium. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation:</strong> Energy traveling as waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. This is the <strong>EM spectrum</strong>, which includes (in order of increasing energy/frequency):
                <br>Radio waves → Microwaves → Infrared → <strong>Visible Light</strong> → Ultraviolet (UV) → <strong>X-rays</strong> → <strong>Gamma rays</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Particle Radiation:</strong> Energy traveling as high-speed subatomic particles (e.g., alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ionizing vs. Non-Ionizing Radiation:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Ionizing:</strong> Lower energy (Radio, Microwave, IR, Visible). Has enough energy to move or vibrate atoms, but not enough to "ionize" them (knock an electron off).</li>
            <li><strong>Ionizing:</strong> Higher energy (UV, X-rays, Gamma rays, and particle radiation). Has enough energy to strip electrons from atoms, creating ions. This is what makes it dangerous to living tissue, as it can break DNA molecules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Radiation Poisoning</h3>
        <p><strong>Radiation poisoning</strong> (or Acute Radiation Syndrome - ARS) is an acute illness caused by exposure to a <strong>large dose of ionizing radiation</strong> over a <strong>short period of time</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> The radiation damages or kills cells in the body, especially cells that divide rapidly (like in the bone marrow, stomach lining, and skin).</li>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Depends on the dose, but typically starts with nausea and vomiting within hours. This may be followed by a period of feeling well, which is then followed by severe illness (infection, bleeding, hair loss) as the bone marrow fails. Very high doses cause neurological failure and rapid death.</li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> Nuclear accidents (e.g., Chernobyl), nuclear weapons, or severe accidents with medical or industrial radiation sources.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Medical Applications of Radiation</h3>
        <p>We can use radiation in controlled ways for great medical benefit, mostly in two categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics (Imaging):</strong> Using radiation to "see" inside the body.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X-rays:</strong> X-rays pass through soft tissue (muscle, fat) but are blocked (absorbed) by dense tissue (like bone). A detector on the other side creates a "shadow" image, showing bones clearly.</li>
                    <li><strong>CT Scans:</strong> A "Computed Tomography" scan is like a 3D X-ray. An X-ray machine spins around the body, taking many cross-section "slices," which a computer then assembles into a detailed 3D image. (See Unit 5)</li>
                    <li><strong>Nuclear Medicine:</strong> A patient ingests or is injected with a radioactive "tracer." The tracer is designed to collect in a specific organ (e.g., the thyroid). A "gamma camera" then detects the gamma rays coming *out* of the patient, showing how the organ is functioning.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Therapy (Treatment):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Radiotherapy (Cancer Treatment):</strong> Uses very high-energy X-rays or gamma rays in a focused beam to <strong>kill cancer cells</strong>. The beam is aimed at the tumor from many different angles, so the tumor gets a massive, lethal dose, while the surrounding healthy tissue only gets a small, survivable dose from each pass.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic4">The Ear and Hearing</h2>

        <h3>The Ear (Working)</h3>
        <p>The ear is a complex organ that converts sound waves (pressure waves in the air) into electrical signals for the brain.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Outer Ear:</strong> The visible part (pinna) acts like a funnel, collecting sound waves and guiding them into the <strong>ear canal</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Ear:</strong> The sound waves hit the <strong>eardrum</strong> (tympanic membrane), causing it to vibrate. These vibrations are passed along and amplified by three tiny bones (the ossicles): the <strong>malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Inner Ear:</strong> The stapes pushes on a membrane called the oval window, sending the vibrations into the <strong>cochlea</strong>. The cochlea is a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled tube. Inside it, tiny <strong>hair cells</strong> are "tuned" to different frequencies. High-frequency sounds vibrate the hair cells near the entrance, while low-frequency sounds vibrate the ones deep inside. When a hair cell vibrates, it sends an electrical signal to the brain via the <strong>auditory nerve</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Hearing Spectra</h3>
        <p>The <strong>hearing spectrum</strong> (or audible range) is the range of sound frequencies that can be heard by a species.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humans:</strong> <strong>20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz)</strong>. We are most sensitive in the 2,000 - 5,000 Hz range (human speech).</li>
            <li><strong>Infrasound:</strong> Frequencies *below* 20 Hz. We can't hear it, but animals like elephants use it to communicate.</li>
            <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> Frequencies *above* 20 kHz. We can't hear it, but dogs, bats, and dolphins use it for echolocation and communication. (See Unit 5 for medical use).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic5">Sound and Acoustics</h2>

        <h3>Sound Waves and Hearing</h3>
        <p><strong>Sound</strong> is a <strong>mechanical wave</strong>, which means it needs a medium (like air, water, or a solid) to travel. It cannot travel through a vacuum. It is a <strong>longitudinal wave</strong>, meaning the particles of the medium vibrate *parallel* to the direction of the wave's travel (creating compressions and rarefactions).</p>
        <p><strong>Hearing</strong> is the brain's perception and interpretation of these vibrations, as detected by the ear.</p>
        
        <h3>Sound Intensity (I)</h3>
        <p><strong>Sound intensity</strong> is the <strong>power</strong> of a sound wave per unit <strong>area</strong>. It is an objective, physical measurement of the energy the wave carries.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>I = Power / Area</strong>   (Units: Watts/m²)
        </blockquote>
        <p>The human ear can detect a *vast* range of intensities, from the "threshold of hearing" (I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m²) to the "threshold of pain" (I ≈ 1 W/m²).</p>
        
        <h3>The Decibel Scale (dB)</h3>
        <p>Because the range of intensities is so huge, we use a <strong>logarithmic scale</strong> called the <strong>decibel scale</strong> to measure <strong>sound level (β)</strong>. This scale is much more manageable and better matches our perception of "loudness."</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>β (in dB) = 10 × log₁₀ ( I / I₀ )</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>`I` is the intensity of the sound.</li>
            <li>`I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m²` is the "threshold of hearing," the reference level.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Understanding the log scale:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>An <strong>increase of 10 dB</strong> means the sound intensity (I) has multiplied by <strong>10</strong>. (e.g., 60 dB is 10 times more intense than 50 dB).</li>
                <li>An <strong>increase of 20 dB</strong> means the intensity has multiplied by <strong>100</strong> (10 × 10).</li>
                <li>An <strong>increase of 3 dB</strong> means the intensity has approximately <strong>doubled</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <table>

            <li><strong>Health:</strong> Hearing loss (damage to the hair cells), high blood pressure, stress, sleep disturbances, heart disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Disrupts animal communication and navigation (especially in the ocean).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any sound <strong>above 85 dB</strong> can cause permanent hearing damage with prolonged exposure.</p>

        <h3>Acoustics of loading and reverberation</h3>
        <p><strong>Acoustics</strong> is the science of sound, particularly how it behaves in an enclosed space (like a concert hall or classroom).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acoustics of "loading":</strong> This is likely a typo for <strong>"auditoriums"</strong> or <strong>"buildings"</strong>. Good acoustic design aims to make sound clear and pleasant.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Hard, flat surfaces (like concrete walls) reflect sound and create <strong>echoes</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Soft, porous surfaces (like curtains, carpets, acoustic foam) awsund, reducing echoes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diffusion:</strong> Irregular, convex surfaces scatter sound in many directions, preventing "flat" echoes and making the sound feel "live."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reverberation:</strong> This is the persistence of sound in a room after the original sound source has stopped. It's the combined effect of thousands of echoes.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reverberation Time (RT60):</strong> The time it takes for the sound level to drop by 60 dB.</li>
                    <li><strong>Too much reverberation (long RT60):</strong> (e.g., in a stone cathedral). Sound becomes "muddy" and speech is hard to understand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Too little reverberation (short RT60):</strong> (e.g., in an anechoic chamber or a room with heavy curtains). The sound is "dead" and flat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good design:</strong> A concert hall for an orchestra needs a "warm" reverberation (RT60 ≈ 2s). A lecture hall needs a "clear" sound (RT60 < 1s).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
