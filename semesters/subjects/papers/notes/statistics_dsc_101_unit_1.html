            <h2>1. Statistical Methods: Definition, Scope, and Limitations</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition of Statistics</h3>
            <p>Statistics is a branch of science that deals with the <strong>collection, organization, presentation, analysis, and interpretation</strong> of data to make effective decisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Gathering data from various sources (surveys, experiments, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Arranging data in a systematic way (e.g., editing, classifying).</li>
                <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Displaying data in an understandable format (e.g., tables, graphs).</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Using statistical tools to process the data (e.g., calculating mean, correlation).</li>
                <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Drawing meaningful conclusions from the analyzed data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scope of Statistics</h3>
            <p>Statistics is used in almost every field:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business and Economics:</strong> Market research, quality control, financial forecasting.</li>
                <li><strong>Science:</strong> Designing experiments, testing hypotheses (e.g., in medicine, biology).</li>
                <li><strong>Government:</strong> Policy making, census data, economic planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Sciences:</strong> Analyzing survey data, studying social trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations of Statistics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deals with aggregates, not individuals:</strong> Statistics provides insights about a group, not a single person or object.</li>
                <li><strong>Deals only with quantitative data:</strong> It cannot directly study qualitative phenomena like honesty or beauty, though they can sometimes be quantified indirectly (e.g., through rating scales).</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical laws are true only "on average":</strong> They are not universally exact like laws of physics. They are laws of probability.</li>
                <li><strong>Prone to misuse:</strong> Data can be manipulated to present a misleading picture. "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."</li>
                <li><strong>Results are only as good as the data:</strong> If the data collected is biased or flawed, the conclusions will also be flawed (Garbage In, Garbage Out - GIGO).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be prepared to define statistics and list its five stages (Collection to Interpretation). The limitations are a very common short-answer question.

            <h2>2. Concepts of Statistical Population and Sample</h2>
            
            <h3>Population</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Population (or Universe):</strong> The entire group of individuals, items, or objects of interest in a statistical study.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finite Population:</strong> A population where the number of units is countable and finite.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> Number of students in your college.</li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> Number of cars manufactured by a company in a year.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Infinite Population:</strong> A population where the number of units is theoretically infinite or so large that it is considered infinite for practical purposes.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> The set of all possible outcomes of rolling a die.</li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> The population of stars in the sky.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sample</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Sample:</strong> A subset or a part of the population selected to represent the characteristics of the whole population.
            </blockquote>
            <p>We study samples because it is often too costly, time-consuming, or impossible to study the entire population. The process of selecting a sample is called <strong>sampling</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> To find the average height of all students in your college (population), you select 100 students (sample) and measure their heights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Parameter vs. Statistic</h3>
            <p>This is a crucial distinction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parameter:</strong> A numerical measure that describes a characteristic of the <strong>population</strong>. (e.g., population mean 'μ', population standard deviation 'σ'). Parameters are usually unknown.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistic:</strong> A numerical measure that describes a characteristic of the <strong>sample</strong>. (e.g., sample mean 'x̄', sample standard deviation 's'). We use statistics to estimate unknown parameters.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Mnemonic:</strong> <strong>P</strong>arameter for <strong>P</strong>opulation. <strong>S</strong>tatistic for <strong>S</strong>ample.

        <section id="data-types">
            <h2>3. Types of Data</h2>
            <p>Data can be broadly classified into two main types:</p>

            <h3>1. Qualitative (or Categorical) Data</h3>
            <p>Data that represents characteristics or attributes. It cannot be measured numerically but can be sorted into categories.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Gender (Male, Female, Other)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Eye Color (Blue, Brown, Green)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Blood Type (A, B, AB, O)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Quantitative (or Numerical) Data</h3>
            <p>Data that is numerical and represents a measurable quantity.</p>
            
            <h4>a) Discrete Data</h4>
            <p>Data that can only take specific, distinct values (usually integers). It is "counted." There are gaps between possible values.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Number of children in a family (0, 1, 2, 3... but not 2.5)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Number of cars passing a toll booth in an hour.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Number of correct answers on a quiz.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>b) Continuous Data</h4>
            <p>Data that can take any value within a given range. It is "measured." There are no gaps between possible values (though our measurements are limited by our tools).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Height of a student (e.g., 170.5 cm, 170.51 cm...)</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Temperature of a room.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Time taken to run a race.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Don't confuse "discrete" with "finite." Shoe size (e.g., 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5) is discrete because it can only take specific values, not *any* value between 7 and 9. Money is also technically discrete (you can't have $10.502), but it's often treated as continuous due to the large number of possible values.
            </div>

            <h3>Other Data Classifications</h3>
            
            <h4>a) Cross-Sectional Data</h4>
            <p>Data collected on different subjects (people, firms, countries) at the <strong>same point in time</strong> or over the same period.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> The stock prices of 100 different companies on January 1, 2025.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> The GDP of all European countries in the year 2024.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>b) Time Series Data</h4>
            <p>Data collected on the <strong>same subject</strong> or variable over a period of time, usually at regular intervals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> The stock price of *one* company (e.g., Google) recorded daily for a year.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> The monthly rainfall in a city from 2010 to 2020.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="scales">
            <h2>4. Scales of Measurement</h2>
            <p>These scales (or levels) describe the nature of information within the values assigned to variables. They are hierarchical (each level up adds more properties).</p>
            
            <h3>1. Nominal Scale</h3>
            <p>The simplest scale. Data consists of categories or names only. There is no natural order or ranking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity (e.g., 'Male' is different from 'Female').</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Counting (frequency), finding the mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Jersey numbers, zip codes, eye color, marital status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Ordinal Scale</h3>
            <p>Data can be categorized and these categories have a natural order or rank. However, the *differences* between the ranks are not meaningful or uniform.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity + Order.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Count, mode, median, rank correlation.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Customer satisfaction (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), educational level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's), grades (A, B, C).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Interval Scale</h3>
            <p>Data is numerical, ordered, and the differences between values are meaningful and uniform. However, there is <strong>no true zero point</strong> (zero is arbitrary and doesn't mean "absence").</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity + Order + Meaningful Differences.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Count, mode, median, mean, standard deviation. Addition and subtraction are meaningful.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C doesn't mean "no heat"), calendar years (Year 0 is arbitrary), IQ scores.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Ratio Scale</h3>
            <p>The highest level of measurement. It has all the properties of the interval scale, plus a <strong>true zero point</strong>, which indicates the "absence" of the quantity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Identity + Order + Meaningful Differences + True Zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> All statistical operations, including multiplication and division (we can form ratios).</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Height, weight, age, income, distance, number of customers. (0 kg means "no weight," $0 means "no money").</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A classic question is "Differentiate between Interval and Ratio scales." The key answer is the <strong>true zero point</strong>. Ask yourself: "Does 0 mean the absence of the thing?" If yes, it's Ratio. If no, it's Interval.

        <section id="collection">
            <h2>5. Collection of Data</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Primary Data</h3>
            <p>Data collected for the <strong>first time</strong> by the researcher, specifically for the purpose of the study. It is original, raw data.</p>
            <h4>Major Sources (Methods of Collection):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Personal Interview:</strong> Face-to-face interview with respondents.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Pros:</em> High accuracy, can use non-verbal-cues, doubts can be clarified.</li>
                        <li><em>Cons:</em> Expensive, time-consuming, potential for interviewer bias.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Indirect Oral Investigation:</strong> Interviewing third parties or witnesses who are close to the situation. (Used when the direct respondent is unavailable or unwilling).</li>
                <li><strong>Questionnaires:</strong> A set of written questions given to respondents.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Mailed Questionnaire:</em> Sent by post or email. (Pros: Wide coverage, low cost. Cons: Low response rate, doubts can't be clarified).</li>
                        <li><em>Questionnaires filled by enumerators:</em> The investigator goes to respondents and fills the questionnaire. (Combines features of interview and questionnaire).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong> The researcher observes and records behavior or events as they happen. (e.g., observing traffic patterns).</li>
                <li><strong>Experiments:</strong> Controlled studies to determine cause-and-effect. (e.g., a medical drug trial).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Secondary Data</h3>
            <p>Data that has <strong>already been collected</strong> by someone else for some other purpose, but is used by the researcher for their current study. It is "second-hand" data.</p>

            <h3>Precautions in Using Secondary Data</h3>
            <p>Before using secondary data, you must check its:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Who collected the data? What was their reputation? Were the methods sound?</li>
                <li><strong>Suitability:</strong> Does the data fit your research purpose? The original purpose might be different.</li>
                <li><strong>Adequacy:</strong> Is the data sufficient for your study? Is the sample size large enough? Is it up-to-date?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>6. Presentation of Data: Classification and Tabulation</h2>
            <p>After collection, raw data is unorganized and hard to understand. We must organize it.</p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>
            <p>The process of sorting data into groups or classes based on their common characteristics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geographical:</strong> By location (e.g., sales by state).</li>
                <li><strong>Chronological:</strong> By time (e.g., population by year).</li>
        <li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> By attribute (e.g., students by gender).</li>
                <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> By numerical value (e.g., people by income group).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tabulation</h3>
            <p>The systematic arrangement of classified data into rows and columns with a title and headings.</p>
            <h4>Main Parts of a Statistical Table:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Table Number:</strong> For identification (e.g., "Table 1.1").</li>
                <li><strong>Title:</strong> A clear and concise description of the table's contents.</li>
                <li><strong>Headnote:</strong> A brief note below the title explaining the unit of measurement (e.g., "in '000s" or "in USD").</li>
                <li><strong>Stubs:</strong> The headings for the rows (usually on the left).</li>
                <li><strong>Captions:</strong> The headings for the columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Body:</strong> The main part of the table containing the numerical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Footnote:</strong> To clarify any specific item in the table.</li>
                <li><strong>Source Note:</strong> To indicate the source of the data (especially for secondary data).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>7. Frequency Distributions and Graphical Representations</h2>
            
            <h3>Frequency Distribution</h3>
            <p>A table that organizes data into classes (or groups) and shows the number of observations (frequency) that fall into each class.</p>
            
            <h4>1. Discrete Frequency Distribution</h4>
            <p>Used for discrete data. We list each distinct value and its corresponding frequency.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> Number of children in 20 families: 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0</p>

            <h4>2. Continuous Frequency Distribution</h4>
            <p>Used for continuous data (or discrete data with a wide range). Data is grouped into <strong>class intervals</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Class Limits:</strong> The lowest (Lower Limit) and highest (Upper Limit) values a class can have. (e.g., 10-19).</li>
                <li><strong>Class Boundaries:</strong> The true limits of a class, used to ensure no gaps. (e.g., 9.5 - 19.5).</li>
                <li><strong>Class Width:</strong> The difference between the upper and lower class boundaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Class Mark (Midpoint):</strong> (Lower Limit + Upper Limit) / 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Cumulative Frequency (CF):</strong> The sum of frequencies up to a certain class (Less than CF) or from that class onwards (More than CF).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Graphical Representations</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Histogram</h4>
            <p>A graph of a continuous frequency distribution. It consists of adjacent rectangles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>X-axis</strong> represents the class boundaries.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Y-axis</strong> represents the frequency (or frequency density).</li>
                <li>The <strong>area</strong> of each rectangle is proportional to the frequency of that class.</li>
                <li>If class widths are equal, the height of the rectangle is proportional to the frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>There are no gaps between the bars.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Frequency Polygon</h4>
            <p>A line graph representing a frequency distribution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is drawn by plotting the <strong>class marks (midpoints)</strong> on the X-axis against the <strong>frequencies</strong> on the Y-axis.</li>
                <li>The points are then joined by straight lines.</li>
                <li>The polygon is "closed" by joining the first and last points to hypothetical class marks at either end with zero frequency.</li>
                <li>A frequency polygon can also be drawn by joining the midpoints of the tops of the rectangles in a histogram.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Frequency Curve</h4>
            <p>A smoothed version of a frequency polygon. It is drawn as a freehand curve through the points of a frequency polygon.</p>
            <p>It gives a better idea of the shape of the distribution (e.g., normal, skewed).</p>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Know the key difference: A <strong>Histogram</strong> uses class *boundaries* on the X-axis and has adjacent bars. A <strong>Bar Graph</strong> (used for categorical data) uses class *names* and has gaps between the bars. A <strong>Frequency Polygon</strong> uses class *midpoints*.
