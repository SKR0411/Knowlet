        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC), or <strong>Harappan Civilisation</strong>, was a <strong>Bronze Age urban civilisation</strong> (c. 2600 BCE â€“ 1900 BCE) in the northwestern regions of South Asia. It was one of the world's three earliest civilisations, along with Mesopotamia and Egypt, but was the most widespread.</p>

        <h2 id="town-planning">2. Town Planning</h2>
        <p>The most striking feature of the IVC was its highly sophisticated urban planning, which was unique in the ancient world.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grid-Iron Pattern:</strong> Cities were meticulously planned on a grid. Main streets ran north-south and east-west, intersecting at <strong>right angles</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Part Division:</strong> Most cities were divided into two parts:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Citadel (Western Mound):</strong> A raised, fortified area built on a mud-brick platform. It housed important public buildings like the <strong>Great Bath</strong> (at Mohenjo-Daro), the <strong>Granaries</strong>, and assembly halls. It was likely occupied by the ruling class.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lower Town (Eastern Mound):</strong> The larger residential area for the common people.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="important-note">
                    <strong>Exception:</strong> <strong>Dholavira</strong> (Gujarat) had a <strong>three-part division</strong> (Citadel, Middle Town, Lower Town) and a sophisticated water reservoir system.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Drainage System:</strong> This is the most impressive feature. Every house was connected to the main street drains. The drains were <strong>covered</strong> with bricks or stone slabs and had <strong>manholes</strong> for cleaning, showing a remarkable concern for public health.</li>
            <li><strong>Building Materials:</strong> They used <strong>standardised, baked bricks</strong> in a uniform ratio (1:2:4) for almost all construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Houses:</strong> Houses were built around a central courtyard and often had private wells and bathrooms.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="socio-economic">3. Socio-economic Life</h2>

        <h3 id="social-life">i) Social Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stratified Society:</strong> The city layout (Citadel vs. Lower Town) implies a social hierarchy, with a ruling class (perhaps merchants or priests) and common people.</li>
            <li><strong>Food:</strong> They cultivated crops like wheat, barley, pulses, and were the <strong>first in the world to grow cotton</strong>. They also consumed meat, fish, and dairy.</li>
            <li><strong>Dress & Ornaments:</strong> Figurines show that both men and women wore ornaments (necklaces, bangles, armlets) made of beads (carnelian, lapis lazuli), shell, and semi-precious stones.</li>
            <li><strong>Amusements:</strong> People played dice, and numerous terracotta toys (carts, animals, whistles) have been found.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="economic-life">ii) Economic Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> This was the backbone of the economy. They used wooden ploughs (models found at Banawali).</li>
            <li><strong>Trade and Commerce:</strong> The IVC had a vast trade network.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal Trade:</strong> With regions in Rajasthan (for copper), Karnataka (for gold), and Gujarat (for stones).</li>
                    <li><strong>External Trade:</strong> They had extensive trade with <strong>Mesopotamia (modern Iraq)</strong>. Mesopotamian texts refer to a trading partner called <strong>"Meluhha,"</strong> which is believed to be the IVC.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Seals and Script:</strong> Trade was likely regulated using <strong>steatite seals</strong>. These are the most unique IVC artifact, often depicting animals (like the "unicorn" bull) and a line of script. The Harappan script is <strong>undeciphered</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Crafts:</strong> They were master craftsmen in bead-making, pottery (glossy Red-and-Black ware), and metal-working. The <strong>"Dancing Girl"</strong> bronze statue from Mohenjo-Daro shows their skill in bronze-casting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="religious-practices">4. Religious Practices</h2>
        <p>Since the script is unread, we must infer their beliefs from artifacts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mother Goddess:</strong> Numerous terracotta figurines of a female deity suggest a fertility cult.</li>
            <li><strong>"Proto-Shiva" (Pashupati Seal):</strong> A famous seal from Mohenjo-Daro shows a three-faced male deity, seated in a yogic posture, crowned with horns, and surrounded by four animals (elephant, tiger, rhino, buffalo). This is often identified as an early form of the Hindu god Shiva.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature Worship:</strong> They revered animals (like the Humped Bull) and trees (like the Pipal tree), which are common motifs on seals.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire Altars:</strong> Structures identified as fire altars at <strong>Kalibangan</strong> and <strong>Lothal</strong> suggest ritual practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Burials:</strong> They practiced burial, typically laying the dead north-south with grave goods (pottery, ornaments).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Point:</strong> There is <strong>no evidence of large temples</strong>, grand palaces, or monumental statues of kings, unlike in Egypt or Mesopotamia.
        </div>
        <h2 id="decline">5. Causes of Decline</h2>
        <p>The IVC began to decline around 1900 BCE, leading to the abandonment of cities. There was no single cause, but a combination of factors.</p>
