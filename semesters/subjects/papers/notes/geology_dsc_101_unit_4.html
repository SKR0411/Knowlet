        <h2 id="topic1">Concept of Stratigraphy</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Stratigraphy is the branch of geology concerned with the study of <strong>rock layers (strata)</strong> and their <strong>sequence in time (layering)</strong>.
        </blockquote>
        <p>It focuses on the order, correlation, and interpretation of layered rocks (mainly sedimentary rocks) to understand Earth's history.</p>

        <h3>The Principles of Stratigraphy</h3>
        <p>These are the fundamental "rules" geologists use to read the rock record. They were largely developed by Nicolaus Steno in the 17th century.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Principle of Superposition:</strong> In an undisturbed sequence of sedimentary rocks, the <strong>oldest layers are at the bottom</strong>, and the <strong>youngest layers are at the top</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Original Horizontality:</strong> Sediments are almost always deposited in <strong>horizontal layers</strong>. If layers are tilted, folded, or faulted, it means they were deformed by tectonic activity *after* they were deposited.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Lateral Continuity:</strong> Sedimentary layers extend horizontally in all directions until they thin out, grade into another rock type, or are cut off by an erosional edge. This allows usto correlate rock layers across valleys.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships:</strong> Any geologic feature (like a fault or an igneous intrusion) that <strong>cuts across</strong> another feature must be <strong>younger</strong> than the feature it cuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Faunal Succession:</strong> Fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and determinable order, and therefore any time period can be recognized by its fossil content. (This is the basis for using <strong>index fossils</strong>).</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="diagram-placeholder">
            <p><strong>Diagram Placeholder:</strong> A cross-section of rock layers showing Superposition (layers A, B, C), a Fault cutting through them (D), and an Igneous Intrusion (E). (Order of events: A, B, C, then D, then E).</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic2">Understanding the past from stratigraphic records</h2>
        <p>The stratigraphic record is like a history book with most of its pages missing and the rest out of order. Geologists reassemble this history by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Matching up rock layers (strata) of the same age from different locations. This can be done by:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lithostratigraphy:</strong> Matching based on rock type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biostratigraphy:</strong> Matching based on the fossils they contain (the most reliable method).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interpreting Past Environments:</strong> The type of rock tells a story. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sandstone</strong> with ripple marks might indicate a beach or river bed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shale</strong> (made of mud) indicates a calm, deep-water environment like a lake bottom or deep ocean.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coal</strong> indicates a swamp environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">Nature of stratigraphic records</h2>
        <p>The rock record is not continuous. There are large gaps in time where either no rocks were deposited or rocks were eroded away. These gaps are called <strong>Unconformities</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Unconformities</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An unconformity is a buried surface of erosion or non-deposition that separates two rock masses of different ages. It represents <strong>missing time</strong> in the geological record.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>There are three main types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Disconformity:</strong> An unconformity between parallel sedimentary layers. This represents a period of erosion or non-deposition, but with no tilting or folding.</li>
            <li><strong>Angular Unconformity:</strong> An unconformity where older, tilted or folded sedimentary layers are overlain by younger, horizontal layers. This shows a sequence of: 1. Deposition, 2. Tilting/Folding, 3. Erosion, 4. New Deposition.</li>
            <li><strong>Nonconformity:</strong> An unconformity where younger sedimentary rocks lie on top of older, eroded igneous or metamorphic rocks.</li>
        </ol>

        </div>

        <h2 id="topic4">Introduction to age dating of rocks</h2>
        <p>Geologists use two main methods to date rocks and events in Earth's history.</p>
        
        <h3>Relative Dating</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Determining the <strong>chronological order</strong> of events (i.e., this rock is older or younger than that rock). It does *not* provide a specific age in years.</li>
            <li><strong>How it's done:</strong> By applying the <strong>Principles of Stratigraphy</strong> (Superposition, Cross-Cutting, etc.) and using <strong>fossils</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In the Grand Canyon, we know the lowest layer (Vishnu Schist) is the oldest, and the top layer (Kaibab Limestone) is the youngest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Absolute Dating (Radiometric Dating)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Determining the <strong>actual age</strong> of a rock or fossil in years (e.g., 66 million years old).</li>
            <li><strong>How it's done:</strong> By measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes in minerals.
                <ul>
                    <li>Radioactive isotopes (the "parent") are unstable and decay at a fixed, predictable rate into a stable "daughter" isotope.</li>
                    <li>The time it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay into daughter atoms is called the <strong>half-life</strong>.</li>
                    <li>By measuring the ratio of parent-to-daughter atoms in a mineral, scientists can calculate how many half-lives have passed since the mineral formed, thus giving its age.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Common Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uranium-Lead (U-Pb) Dating:</strong> Used for very old rocks (billions of years).</li>
                    <li><strong>Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) Dating:</strong> Used for volcanic rocks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiocarbon (Carbon-14) Dating:</strong> Used for young (less than ~50,000 years), <em>organic</em> materials (like wood, bones, fossils). It cannot be used on rocks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> Do not confuse Relative and Absolute dating.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relative</strong> = Order (Older/Younger). Uses Stratigraphy.</li>
                <li><strong>Absolute</strong> = Number (Years). Uses Radioactive Decay / Half-life.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic5">Fossil and its types</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A fossil is the preserved remains, trace, or imprint of a once-living organism from a past geological age.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Types of Fossils (Modes of Preservation)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Body Fossils (Preserved Remains):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unaltered Remains:</strong> Rare. The original hard parts (or even soft parts) are preserved. Examples: Insects in amber, mammoths frozen in ice, original shells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Altered Remains:</strong> The original material is changed.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Petrifaction (or Petrification):</strong> "Turned to stone." This happens in two ways:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Permineralization:</strong> Minerals (like silica) dissolved in groundwater fill the empty pore spaces (e.g., petrified wood).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> The original material (like a shell) dissolves away and is simultaneously replaced by new minerals.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Carbonization:</strong> Only a thin black film of carbon is left, common for plants and fish.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Molds and Casts:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mold:</strong> A hollow impression of an organism (like a seashell print in wet sand that hardens). An <em>external mold</em> is the outside, an <em>internal mold</em> is the filled-in inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cast:</strong> A 3D copy of the organism, formed when a mold is later filled in with sediment or minerals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trace Fossils (Ichnofossils):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Evidence of an organism's <em>activity</em>, not its body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Footprints, tracks, burrows, coprolites (fossilized feces).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Index Fossils:</strong> These are special fossils used for relative dating (biostratigraphy). A good index fossil is:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Geographically widespread</strong> (found in many places).</li>
                <li><strong>Abundant</strong> (easy to find).</li>
                <li><strong>Lived for a short geologic time</strong> (so it pinpoints a specific time period).</li>
            </ol>
            Trilobites and Ammonites are excellent index fossils.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic6">Evolution of life through geological time</h2>
        <p>The fossil record, read using the Geological Time Scale, shows a clear history of the evolution of life on Earth.</p>
