        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Maurya Empire (c. 322 BCE – 185 BCE) was the first and largest <strong>pan-Indian empire</strong>, a vast centralized state that controlled almost the entire subcontinent. Its foundation by Chandragupta Maurya and the reign of Ashoka represent a pivotal moment in Indian history.</p>

        <h2 id="sources">2. Sources: Kautilya's Arthasashtra, Indica of Megasthenes</h2>
        <p>Our understanding of the Mauryas is uniquely rich due to two key texts, supplemented by Ashokan edicts and later Puranas.</p>

        <h3>i) Kautilya's Arthasashtra</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Author:</strong> Kautilya (also known as Chanakya or Vishnugupta), the prime minister of Chandragupta Maurya.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> It is <em>not</em> a history book. It is a <strong>prescriptive treatise on statecraft</strong>, politics, economics, and military strategy. It describes how a strong, centralized state *should* be run.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Insights:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Saptanga Theory:</strong> Describes the seven elements (limbs) of a state: *Svamin* (King), *Amatya* (Ministers), *Janapada* (Territory/People), *Durga* (Fort), *Kosa* (Treasury), *Danda* (Army/Force), and *Mitra* (Ally).</li>
                    <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Details a highly bureaucratic state with numerous *Adhyakshas* (Superintendents) for different departments (e.g., commerce, agriculture, mining).</li>
                    <li><strong>Espionage:</strong> Emphasizes a vast and efficient spy system (*Gudhapurushas*) as the "eyes and ears" of the king.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Indica of Megasthenes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Author:</strong> Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador sent by To the court of Chandragupta Maurya in Pataliputra.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> The original *Indica* is lost. We only have fragments and quotations from later Greek and Roman writers like Strabo, Arrian, and Diodorus.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Insights (An Outsider's View):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>City of Pataliputra:</strong> Described it as a massive, fortified city on the banks of the Ganga and Son rivers.</li>
                    <li><strong>City Administration:</strong> Famously describes the administration of Pataliputra as being run by <strong>six committees of five members each</strong>, managing: 1) Industry, 2) Foreigners, 3) Births and Deaths, 4) Trade, 5) Manufactured Goods, and 6) Tax Collection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Division:</strong> Mistakenly described Indian society as having <strong>seven classes</strong> (e.g., philosophers, farmers, soldiers, herdsmen, artisans, magistrates, councillors). This was a flawed observation, likely confusing caste, occupation, and administrative roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Slavery:</strong> He noted the absence of slavery in India, which was likely an error, as different forms of servitude (*Dasa*) did exist.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cgm">3. Chandragupta Maurya: Conquests & Achievements</h2>
        <p><em>(Reign c. 322 BCE – 298 BCE)</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Founder:</strong> He was the founder of the Maurya Empire. Of humble origins, he was trained by Kautilya at Taxila.</li>
            <li><strong>Overthrow of the Nandas:</strong> His first major achievement was to defeat the last Nanda ruler, <strong>Dhana Nanda</strong>, and capture the throne of Magadha.</li>
            <li><strong>Liberation of the Northwest:</strong> He took advantage of the power vacuum left by Alexander's departure and conquered the Greek satrapies in the Indus valley.</li>
            <li><strong>War with Seleucus Nicator (c. 305 BCE):</strong> He fought a successful war against Seleucus, Alexander's general who controlled the eastern part of his empire. In the resulting treaty, Chandragupta gained a vast territory (modern-day Afghanistan and Balochistan) and married Seleucus's daughter. In return, he gifted 500 war elephants.</li>
            <li><strong>Conquests:</strong> He unified North India and also expanded into the Deccan, creating the first pan-Indian empire.</li>
            <li><strong>Jain Tradition:</strong> According to Jain tradition, in his last days, he abdicated the throne, became a Jain monk, and traveled to Sravanabelagola (in Karnataka), where he performed *Sallekhana* (fasting unto death).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="dhamma">4. Ashoka's Dhamma</h2>
        <p><em>(Reign c. 268 BCE – 232 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>Ashoka's concept of Dhamma was the most unique feature of his reign, which he formulated after the bloody <strong>Kalinga War (c. 261 BCE)</strong>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>What is Dhamma?</strong> It is <strong>not a new religion</strong>. It is a <strong>moral and ethical code of conduct</strong> based on social responsibility, aimed at creating a harmonious and peaceful society in a vast, diverse empire.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key Principles of Dhamma (from his Edicts):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ahimsa:</strong> Non-violence to all living beings (including a ban on animal sacrifice).</li>
            <li><strong>Respect (Seva):</strong> Respect for elders, teachers, parents, and ascetics (Brahmins and Sramanas).</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Conduct:</strong> Humane treatment of servants and slaves (*Dasas*).</li>
            <li><strong>Religious Tolerance:</strong> He actively preached respect for all religious sects.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejection of Rituals:</strong> He dismissed many common ceremonies and rituals as "petty and worthless."</li>
            <li><strong>Dhamma-Yatra:</strong> He replaced the king's traditional pleasure/hunting tours (*Vihara-yatra*) with "Dhamma tours" to spread his message.</li>
            <li><strong>New Officials:</strong> He created a new class of officials called the <strong>Dhamma Mahamattas</strong> to spread and enforce Dhamma.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="decline">6. The Decline of the Mauryan Empire</h2>
        <p>The mighty empire collapsed within 50 years of Ashoka's death (c. 185 BCE). There was no single cause, but a combination of factors.</p>

        <h3>Key Theories for Decline:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weak Successors:</strong> Ashoka's sons and grandsons were weak and unable to control the vast, complex empire.</li>
            <li><strong>Brahminical Reaction (H.P. Shastri's Theory):</strong> Ashoka's policies (banning sacrifice, promoting Ahimsa) and his perceived favoritism towards Buddhism angered the Brahmins. This is supported by the fact that the last Mauryan king, <strong>Brihadratha</strong>, was assassinated by his Brahmin general, <strong>Pushyamitra Shunga</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Strain:</strong> The massive cost of maintaining a standing army and a huge bureaucracy, plus Ashoka's grants to monasteries, may have bankrupted the treasury.</li>
            <li><strong>Oppressive Provincial Rule:</strong> Ashoka's own edicts mention that he worried about the misrule of "wicked" officials in provinces like Taxila, leading to popular revolts.</li>
            <li><strong>Vastness and Communication:</strong> The sheer size of the empire made it difficult to control from the center in an age of slow communication.</li>
            <li><strong>External Invasions:</strong> The weakening of the empire's northwestern frontier allowed the <strong>Bactrian Greeks</strong> to begin their invasions.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Question: "Critically analyze the causes for the decline of the Mauryan Empire."</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>How to Answer:</strong> Start by stating that there is no single cause. Then, list and explain 3-4 major factors (e.g., Weak Successors, Brahminical Reaction, Economic Strain, External Invasions). A good answer will show how these factors were interconnected.
