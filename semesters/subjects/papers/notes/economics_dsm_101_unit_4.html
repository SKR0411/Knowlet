        <h2 id="topic1">Meaning, Nature and Scope of Macro Economics</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <p>The term "Macroeconomics" comes from the Greek word <em>"makros,"</em> meaning "large." Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of the <strong>economy as a whole</strong>. Instead of focusing on individual units (like a single consumer or firm), it examines economy-wide aggregates (totals) such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total National Income (GDP)</li>
            <li>The General Price Level (Inflation)</li>
            <li>Total Employment (Unemployment)</li>
            <li>Economic Growth</li>
            <li>Balance of Payments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is also known as the <strong>Theory of Income and Employment</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Nature of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aggregate Study:</strong> It deals with aggregates or averages of the entire economy, not individual components.</li>
            <li><strong>General Equilibrium:</strong> It is concerned with the equilibrium of the entire economy (all markets simultaneously), unlike microeconomics which uses partial equilibrium.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy-Oriented:</strong> It is heavily focused on solving economy-wide problems (like inflation and unemployment) through government policies (fiscal and monetary).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Scope of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <p>The scope (areas of study) of macroeconomics includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Theory of National Income:</strong> Studying the concepts of national income and its measurement (GDP, GNP, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Employment:</strong> Analyzing the causes of unemployment and the determinants of the level of employment (e.g., Classical vs. Keynesian theories).</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Money:</strong> Understanding the functions of money, its demand and supply, and its impact on the economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of General Price Level:</strong> Studying inflation, deflation, and their causes.</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of Economic Growth:</strong> Examining the long-run factors that lead to an increase in a country's production capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Theory of International Trade:</strong> Analyzing open-economy issues like exchange rates and the balance of payments.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="topic2">Importance and Limitations of Macro Economics</h2>
        
        <h3>Importance of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Understanding the Economy:</strong> It provides a "big picture" view of how the economy functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Formulating Government Policy:</strong> It is the basis for government <strong>fiscal policy</strong> (taxes, spending) and <strong>monetary policy</strong> (money supply, interest rates) used to combat recessions, control inflation, and reduce unemployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Planning:</strong> Helps governments set targets for economic growth and development.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> Aggregates like GDP and inflation are used to measure an economy's performance over time.</li>
            <li><strong>International Comparison:</strong> Allows us to compare the economic performance and living standards of different countries.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Limitations of Macroeconomics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fallacy of Composition:</strong> This is the biggest limitation. It's the mistaken belief that what is true for an individual part is also true for the whole.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example 1:</em> If one person saves more, they become richer (micro). If *everyone* saves more, demand falls, leading to a recession, and everyone becomes poorer (macro). This is the <strong>Paradox of Thrift</strong>.</li>
                    <li><em>Example 2:</em> If one farmer has a bumper crop, they benefit. If *all* farmers have a bumper crop, prices crash, and all farmers may suffer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Excessive Generalization:</strong> It deals with aggregates, which can hide important structural changes or significant differences between sectors, regions, or groups of people (e.g., ignoring income inequality).</li>
            <li><strong>Ignores Individual Welfare:</strong> A high GDP doesn't mean *everyone* is well-off (it ignores income distribution).</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Key Point:</strong> Micro and Macro are not separate, but <strong>interdependent</strong>. The whole (macro) is the sum of its parts (micro), and the parts (micro) are influenced by the whole (macro).

        <h2 id="topic4">Macro Dynamics: Concept of - Two Sector, Three Sector and Four Sector Economy</h2>
        
        <p>This refers to the <strong>Circular Flow of Income</strong>, a model that shows how income and spending flow between different sectors of the economy. It illustrates the fundamental concept that <strong>Total Production = Total Income = Total Expenditure</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Two-Sector Economy Model</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sectors:</strong> <strong>Households</strong> and <strong>Firms</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> A closed economy with no government.</li>
            <li><strong>Flows:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Households provide factors of production (labor, land) to Firms.</li>
                    <li>Firms pay factor incomes (wages, rent) to Households.</li>
                    <li>Households use this income to buy goods and services from Firms (Consumption spending).</li>
                    <li>Firms provide these goods and services to Households.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> Y = C + I (where C is consumption and I is investment). The main <strong>leakage</strong> is <strong>Saving (S)</strong> and the main <strong>injection</strong> is <strong>Investment (I)</strong>. Equilibrium is where <strong>S = I</strong>.</li>

            <li><strong>Sectors:</strong> <strong>Households</strong>, <strong>Firms</strong>, and <strong>Government (G)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> A closed economy (no foreign trade).</li>
            <li><strong>New Flows:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Government collects <strong>Taxes (T)</strong> from Households and Firms (a <strong>leakage</strong>).</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> Y = C + I + G. The leakages must equal the injections.
                <br><strong>Leakages = Injections</strong>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> Y = C + I + G + (X - M). (X-M is Net Exports).
