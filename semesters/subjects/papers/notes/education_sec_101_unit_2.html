        <h2 id="topic1">1. Philosophy of Yoga, Meaning and Misconception of Yoga, Types of Yoga</h2>

        <h3>Philosophy and Meaning of Yoga</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The word "Yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root <strong>'Yuj'</strong>, which means <strong>'to yoke', 'to join', or 'to unite'</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> The core philosophy of yoga is this 'union'. It refers to the union of the individual consciousness (<em>Atman</em>) with the universal consciousness (<em>Brahman</em>). On a practical level, it is the union of <strong>body, mind, and spirit</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Patanjali's Definition:</strong> In the Yoga Sutras, yoga is defined as <em>"Yogas chitta vritti nirodhah"</em> — which means "Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations (vrittis) of the mind (chitta)."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Misconceptions of Yoga</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Misconception 1: Yoga is just physical exercise.</strong>
                <ul><li><strong>Reality:</strong> The physical postures (asanas) are only one small part (one of the eight limbs). Yoga is a complete holistic practice that includes ethics, breathwork, meditation, and a philosophy for living.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Misconception 2: Yoga is a religion.</strong>
                <ul><li><strong>Reality:</strong> Yoga is a philosophy and a science of the mind and body. It is not a religion. It can be practiced by people of any faith or no faith at all.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Misconception 3: You have to be flexible to do yoga.</strong>
                <ul><li><strong>Reality:</strong> This is like saying you have to be clean to take a bath. You do yoga *to become* more flexible. Flexibility is a *result* of yoga, not a prerequisite.</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Yoga (The Four Paths)</h3>
        <p>Traditional yoga philosophy outlines four main paths to achieve the goal of "union."</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Raja Yoga (The "Royal Path" / Yoga of Mind Control):</strong>
                <ul><li>This path focuses on controlling the mind through a systematic process of meditation.</li><li><strong>Patanjali's Astanga Yoga</strong> (Eight Limbs) is the complete framework for Raja Yoga.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Karma Yoga (The "Path of Action" / Yoga of Selfless Service):</strong>
                <ul><li>This path involves doing one's duty and performing actions (Karma) <strong>without attachment to the results</strong>.</li><li>It is about dedicating one's work to a higher purpose.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Jnana Yoga (The "Path of Knowledge" / Yoga of Wisdom):</strong>
                <ul><li>This is the intellectual path of study and self-inquiry.</li><li>It uses the mind and intellect to discern the real from the unreal and achieve self-realization.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bhakti Yoga (The "Path of Devotion"):</strong>
                <ul><li>This is the emotional path of love and devotion to a divine being or concept.</li><li>It involves practices like chanting (mantra), prayer, and rituals to channel emotions towards the divine.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hatha Yoga:</strong>
                <ul><li>This is the most well-known type in the West. It is a branch of Raja Yoga that focuses on the <strong>physical body</strong> (asanas, pranayama, kriyas) as the primary tool to purify the body and prepare it for meditation.</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Patanjali Yoga Sutra - Astanga Yoga, Yam, Niyama</h2>

        <h3>Patanjali Yoga Sutra</h3>
        <p>This is the foundational text of Raja Yoga, written by the sage Patanjali around 400 CE. It is a collection of 196 "sutras" (aphorisms) that outline the entire philosophy and practice of yoga. It is most famous for codifying the <strong>Astanga Yoga</strong>, or the "Eight-Limbed Path."</p>
        
        <h3>Astanga Yoga (The Eight Limbs)</h3>
        <p><span id="spap_2">This is the step-by-step path to achieve the final goal of yoga (Samadhi).</span> The eight limbs are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Yama (Social Ethics / Moral Restraints):</strong> How we relate to the external world. There are 5 Yamas:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ahimsa:</strong> Non-violence (in thought, word, and deed).</li>
                    <li><strong>Satya:</strong> Truthfulness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asteya:</strong> Non-stealing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brahmacharya:</strong> Continence or moderation, especially of the senses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aparigraha:</strong> Non-hoarding or non-possessiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Niyama (Personal Observances / Self-Discipline):</strong> How we relate to our inner world. There are 5 Niyamas:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Saucha:</strong> Cleanliness (of body, mind, and environment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Santosha:</strong> Contentment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tapas:</strong> Austerity or self-discipline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Svadhyaya:</strong> Self-study (of scriptures and of oneself).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ishvara Pranidhana:</strong> Surrender to a higher power or cosmic will.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <div class="exam-tip">
                <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> The Yamas and Niyamas are the <strong>foundation</strong> of the entire yoga practice. Asanas (postures) are only the *third* limb.
            </div>
            <li><strong>Asana:</strong> Physical postures. Patanjali defines it as <em>"Sthira Sukham Asanam"</em> — a posture that is <strong>steady (Sthira) and comfortable (Sukham)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Pranayama:</strong> Control of <em>prana</em> (life-force energy) through breath regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Pratyahara:</strong> Withdrawal of the senses from external objects to turn the focus inward.</li>
            <li><strong>Dharana:</strong> Concentration (fixing the mind on a single point).</li>
            <li><strong>Dhyana:</strong> Meditation (an *uninterrupted* flow of concentration).</li>
            <li><strong>Samadhi:</strong> Absorption or enlightenment. The state of "union" where the individual self merges with the universal.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">3. Dhyana (Yoga), Bhakti Yoga and Mantra Yoga</h2>
        
        <h3>Dhyana (Meditation)</h3>
        <p>As the <strong>7th limb of Astanga Yoga</strong>, Dhyana is the goal that the first 6 limbs prepare us for. It is often misunderstood.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dharana vs. Dhyana:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dharana (Concentration)</strong> is the *act* of forcing the mind to focus on one thing (like a candle flame or the breath). It takes effort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dhyana (Meditation)</strong> is the *state* that happens when concentration becomes effortless. It is a continuous, unbroken flow of awareness, without the "effort" of focusing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bhakti Yoga</h3>
        <p>(Covered in "Types of Yoga" above). This is the path of devotion. It uses emotions as the pathway to union. Practices include prayer, chanting, and seeing the divine in all things. It is considered one of the easiest paths for many people as it channels the powerful human emotion of love.</p>
        
        <h3>Mantra Yoga</h3>
        <p>Mantra Yoga is the practice of using <strong>sound vibrations (Mantras)</strong> to focus the mind and alter consciousness. A mantra is a word, sound, or phrase (like the sound "Om") that is repeated silently or aloud. The repetition (called <em>Japa</em>) helps to stop the "mind chatter," leading to a state of Dhyana.</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Surya Namaskara, Pranayama, Bandhas, Mudra, Kriyas and Meditation in relation to holistic health</h2>

        <h3>Surya Namaskara (Sun Salutation)</h3>
        <p>A dynamic sequence of <strong>12 asanas</strong> linked together with the breath. It is a complete practice in itself, warming up and stretching the entire body. It improves cardiovascular health, flexibility, and circulation, promoting <strong>physical health</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Pranayama (Breath Control)</h3>
        <p>(The 4th limb). These are techniques to control the breath (e.g., Anulom-Vilom). By controlling the breath, we directly influence our nervous system, calming the mind. This practice directly links <strong>physical health (body)</strong> with <strong>mental health (mind)</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Bandhas (Energy Locks)</h3>
        <p>These are subtle internal muscular "locks" (e.g., Mula Bandha, Uddiyana Bandha) that are engaged during asana or pranayama. Their purpose is to lock and direct the flow of <em>prana</em> (life force) within the body, leading to greater energy and vitality.</p>
        
        <h3>Mudra (Gestures)</h3>
        <p>These are symbolic gestures, usually made with the hands (e.g., <em>Jnana Mudra</em>, where thumb and index finger touch). Mudras are believed to guide the flow of prana and have a subtle effect on mood and consciousness.</p>
        
        <h3>Kriyas (Cleansing Techniques)</h3>
        <p>These are part of Hatha Yoga, designed to <strong>purify the internal body</strong>. Examples include <em>Neti</em> (nasal cleansing) and <em>Kapalbhati</em> (cleansing breath). They promote <strong>physical health</strong> by removing toxins and blockages.</p>
        
        <h3>Meditation (Dhyana)</h3>
        <p>(The 7th limb). This is the practice of calming the mind to achieve a state of restful awareness. It directly promotes <strong>mental and emotional health</strong> by reducing stress, anxiety, and improving focus.</p>

        <h3>Relation to Holistic Health:</h3>
        <p>Together, these practices form a perfect system for <strong>holistic health</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asanas, Kriyas, Surya Namaskara</strong> purify and strengthen the <strong>Physical</strong> body.</li>
            <li><strong>Pranayama, Bandhas, Mudras</strong> balance the <strong>Emotional</strong> and <strong>Energetic</strong> systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Meditation (Dhyana)</strong> calms and clarifies the <strong>Mental</strong> state.</li>
            <li>The entire practice, when done with awareness, promotes <strong>Spiritual</strong> well-being by connecting us to our inner self.</li>
        </ul>
