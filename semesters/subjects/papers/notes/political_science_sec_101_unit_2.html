        <h2 id="intro">1. <span id="span_20">Introduction to Local Self-Government</span></h2>
        <p>Local Self-Government refers to the governance of local affairs by bodies elected by the local people. It is the third tier of government in India, below the Union and State governments. The goal is <strong>democratic decentralization</strong>â€”transferring power to the grassroots level.</p>
        <p>These institutions were given constitutional status by the **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992**, which mandated the creation of Panchayats (for rural areas) and Municipalities (for urban areas).</p>
        <span id="span_21"><span id="span_22"><p>The role of representatives here is less about law-making and more about <strong>planning, implementation, and administration</strong> of local development and welfare.</span></span></p>

        <h2 id="rural">2. <span id="span_23">Rural Local Self-Governments (Panchayati Raj)</span></h2>
