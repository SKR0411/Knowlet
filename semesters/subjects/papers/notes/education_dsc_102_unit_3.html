            <strong>Note:</strong> Childhood is typically divided into two stages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Childhood (The "Play Age"):</strong> 2 to 6 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Later Childhood (The "Gang Age"):</strong> 6 to 12 years (or till puberty).</li>
            </ul>
            The syllabus combines them, but we will differentiate where necessary.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic1">1. Characteristics of Childhood</h2>

        <h3>Early Childhood (2-6 years)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Physical growth slows down compared to infancy. Motor skills (gross and fine) become more refined.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive:</strong> This is Piaget's <strong>Preoperational Stage</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Egocentrism:</strong> The child cannot see the world from another person's perspective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Animism:</strong> Believing that inanimate objects (like toys) are alive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> This is the "why" age. The child is extremely curious.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Social:</strong> The child's social world expands beyond the family. They begin to play with other children, often in "parallel play" (playing *beside* others) before moving to "cooperative play".</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional:</strong> Emotions are still intense, but the child begins to learn about social rules for expressing them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Later Childhood (6-12 years)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Growth is slow and steady. This is a period of great physical energy, and children love games and sports.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive:</strong> This is Piaget's <strong>Concrete Operational Stage</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>The child can now think <strong>logically</strong> about <strong>concrete</strong> objects and events.</li>
                    <li>They understand <strong>Conservation</strong> (that quantity remains the same despite changes in shape, e.g., water in a tall vs. wide glass).</li>
                    <li>They can perform classification and seriation (arranging items in order).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Social:</strong> This is the <strong>"Gang Age"</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>peer group</strong> becomes extremely important.</li>
                    <li>Children form same-sex groups ("gangs") with strong loyalty and rules.</li>
                    <li>This is crucial for learning social skills, cooperation, and competition.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emotional:</strong> Emotional control improves. The child learns to hide or mask emotions to fit in with the peer group.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Social, Emotional and Moral Development</h2>

        <h3>Social Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Childhood:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moves from solitary and parallel play to simple cooperative play.</li>
                    <li>The family is still the primary social influence.</li>
                    <li>Begins to learn social roles (e.g., "gender roles") through imitation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Later Childhood:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>peer group ("gang")</strong> becomes the dominant agent of socialization.</li>
                    <li>The child learns loyalty, leadership, and teamwork.</li>
                    <li>Conformity to group norms (e.g., dress, language) is very high.</li>
                    <li>The school environment (teachers, classmates) also becomes a major social influence.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Emotional Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Childhood:</strong> Emotions are still frequent and intense (e.g., temper tantrums). Fears (of the dark, monsters) are common.</li>
            <li><strong>Later Childhood:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a marked increase in <strong>emotional control</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Children learn that open expression of emotion (like crying) is seen as "babyish," especially by peers.</li>
                    <li>Emotions become more complex, including jealousy, pride, and shame.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Moral Development</h3>
        <p>This refers to the development of a sense of right and wrong. (Based on theories by Piaget and Kohlberg).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Childhood:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Morality is externally controlled (<strong>Heteronomous Morality</strong> - Piaget).</li>
                    <li>"Right" and "Wrong" are determined by the <strong>consequences</strong> (punishment or reward) given by adults.</li>
                    <li><em>Example: "Stealing is wrong because you get spanked."</em> (Kohlberg's Pre-conventional Level).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Later Childhood:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The child begins to understand that rules are made by people and can be changed (<strong>Autonomous Morality</strong>).</li>
                    <li>Morality is based on <strong>conformity</strong> to social rules and the desire to be a "good boy" or "good girl."</li>
                    <li>They begin to understand the importance of <strong>intention</strong>. (Breaking 5 cups by accident is seen as less naughty than breaking 1 cup on purpose).</li>
                    <li><em>Example: "You should not steal because it's against the law," or "You should be nice because that's what good people do."</em> (Kohlberg's Conventional Level).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be able to clearly distinguish the social, emotional, and moral characteristics of <strong>Early Childhood</strong> vs. <strong>Later Childhood</strong>. The "Gang Age" is a key concept for Later Childhood.
        </div>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Language Development</h2>
        <p><span id="spap_4">During childhood, language development explodes, moving from simple sentences to complex, adult-like communication.</span></p>

        <h3>Characteristics of Language Development</h3>
        <h4>Early Childhood (2-6 years)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary Growth:</strong> A "vocabulary explosion" occurs. A child goes from ~50 words at age 2 to several thousand by age 6.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentence Structure:</strong> Moves from telegraphic speech (2 words) to full, complex sentences (5-6 words or more).</li>
            <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Children begin to master grammar, but often make errors of <strong>overregularization</strong> (e.g., "I runned fast," "He gaved me," applying the '-ed' rule to irregular verbs). This is a good sign, as it shows they are learning the *rules* of language.</li>
            <li><strong>Pragmatics:</strong> The child begins to learn the social rules of language (e.g., "please" and "thank you," taking turns in conversation).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Later Childhood (6-12 years)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Vocabulary continues to grow, including more abstract words.</li>
            <li><strong>Grammar and Syntax:</strong> The child masters complex grammatical structures (e.g., passive voice, conditional sentences).</li>
            <li><strong>Reading and Writing:</strong> Formal instruction in reading and writing begins, opening up a new dimension of language.</li>
            <li><strong>Metalinguistic Awareness:</strong> The child develops the ability to *think about* language itself. They can understand jokes, puns, and riddles, which rely on the double meanings of words.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Emotional Patterns and Control</h2>
        <p>This is a more focused look at emotional development during childhood.</p>

        <h3>Emotional Patterns (Common Emotions in Childhood)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear:</strong> In early childhood, fears are often imaginary (monsters, dark). In later childhood, they become more realistic and school-related (fear of failing a test, fear of social rejection).</li>
            <li><strong>Anger:</strong> In early childhood, anger is expressed through physical tantrums. In later childhood, it is more likely to be expressed verbally (name-calling, sulking) or held in.</li>
            <li><strong>Jealousy:</strong> Often arises in early childhood with the birth of a sibling. In later childhood, it can be related to peer popularity or possessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Affection:</strong> In early childhood, affection is openly expressed to family. In later childhood (especially for boys), open affection for parents may decrease, while affection for friends increases.</li>
            <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> High in early childhood ("why?"). In later childhood, it becomes more focused on specific interests and hobbies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Development of Emotional Control</h3>
        <p>A key task of childhood is moving from external control to internal control of emotions. This is part of <strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identifying Emotions:</strong> The child first learns to name their own feelings (e.g., "I am sad").</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding Causes:</strong> They begin to understand *why* they feel a certain way (e.g., "I am sad because he broke my toy").</li>
            <li><strong>Social Norms:</strong> They learn which emotional displays are acceptable and which are not. (The peer group is a powerful teacher here).</li>
            <li><strong>Coping Strategies:</strong> They develop strategies to manage negative emotions (e.g., talking about a problem instead of hitting, finding a quiet place when angry).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Role of Adults (Parents/Teachers):</strong> Adults play a crucial role in teaching emotional control by:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Showing how to handle their own emotions maturely.</li>
                <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Helping the child name their feelings ("It looks like you are very angry right now").</li>
                <li><strong>Coaching:</strong> Suggesting appropriate ways to express those feelings.</li>
            </ul>
