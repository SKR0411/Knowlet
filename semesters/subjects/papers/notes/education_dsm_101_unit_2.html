        <h2 id="topic1">1. Perception</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning and Process of Perception</h3>
        <p>Perception is the process of organizing, interpreting, and giving meaning to the raw sensory information we receive from the environment.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Sensation vs. Perception:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensation</strong> is the simple, raw experience of a stimulus (e.g., light hitting your eye). It is a passive process.</li>
                <li><strong>Perception</strong> is the active process of *interpreting* that sensation (e.g., recognizing that the light is a "red car").</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote><strong>Perception = Sensation + Meaning</strong></blockquote>
        </div>

        <h4>Process of Perception:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sensory Input:</strong> Our sense organs (eyes, ears, etc.) detect a stimulus.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention (Selection):</strong> We select which stimuli to focus on (see next topic).</li>
            <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Our brain organizes the selected information into a meaningful pattern (this is where Gestalt theory comes in).</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> We assign meaning to the pattern based on our past experiences, values, and expectations.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Gestalt Theory of Perception</h3>
        <p>Gestalt is a German word meaning 'form', 'pattern', or 'whole'. The Gestalt psychologists (Max Wertheimer, KÃ¶hler, Koffka) believed that we perceive the world in <strong>meaningful wholes</strong>, not just as a collection of parts.</p>
        <p>The core idea is: <strong>"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Laws of Perceptual Organization (Gestalt Laws):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Law of Figure-Ground:</strong> We instinctively divide any perception into a 'figure' (what we focus on) and a 'ground' (the background).
                </li>
            <li><strong>Law of Proximity:</strong> We tend to group objects that are <em>near</em> each other.
                </li>
            <li><strong>Law of Similarity:</strong> We tend to group objects that are <em>similar</em> to each other (e.g., by color, shape).
                </li>
            <li><strong>Law of Closure:</strong> Our minds tend to fill in the gaps to perceive a complete, whole object.
                </li>
            <li><strong>Law of Continuity:</strong> We tend to perceive continuous, smooth lines or patterns rather than discontinuous ones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Attention</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Attention</h3>
        <p>Attention is the <strong>selective focus of consciousness</strong> on a particular stimulus or object, while ignoring other stimuli.</p>
        <p>It is like a mental "spotlight" that we shine on one part of our environment.</p>

        <h3>Condition (Factors) of Attention</h3>
        <p>What makes us pay attention to one thing and not another? These factors can be:</p>
        
        <h4>External (Objective) Factors:</h4>
        <p>These are characteristics of the stimulus itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> A louder sound, brighter light, or stronger smell.</li>
            <li><strong>Size:</strong> A larger object is more likely to get attention.</li>
            <li><strong>Change/Novelty:</strong> We pay attention to new or changing stimuli. (e.g., a teacher suddenly speaking quietly).</li>
            <li><strong>Movement:</strong> A moving object stands out against a static background.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> A stimulus that is repeated (like a ringing phone) demands attention.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Internal (Subjective) Factors:</h4>
        <p>These are characteristics of the individual.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest:</strong> We easily pay attention to things we are interested in.</li>
            <li><strong>Motive/Need:</strong> A hungry person will notice food advertisements.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Set:</strong> Our "readiness" or expectation. (e.g., If you are expecting a call, you will hear the phone ring immediately).</li>
            <li><strong>Habit:</strong> We are conditioned to pay attention to certain things (e.g., hearing our name).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Span, Distraction, and Fluctuation of Attention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Span of Attention:</strong> Refers to the <strong>number of objects</strong> we can accurately perceive in a single, brief glance. For an average adult, this is about 4-5 objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Distraction of Attention:</strong> This is when our attention is pulled away from our intended focus by an irrelevant stimulus (e.t., noise outside the classroom).</li>
            <li><strong>Fluctuation of Attention:</strong> Our attention is not perfectly stable. It naturally shifts or "fluctuates" every few seconds, even when we are focused. We cannot focus on a single, unchanging object for long.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Emotion</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Emotion</h3>
        <p>The word 'Emotion' comes from the Latin <em>'emovere'</em>, meaning 'to stir up' or 'to agitate'.</p>
        <p>Emotions are complex psychological states involving three components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>A Physiological Arousal:</strong> (e.g., increased heart rate, sweating).</li>
            <li><strong>An Expressive Behavior:</strong> (e.g., smiling, frowning, running).</li>
            <li><strong>A Conscious Experience:</strong> (e.g., the subjective feeling of 'happiness' or 'fear').</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Theories of Emotion</h3>
        
        <h4>James-Lange Theory</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theorists:</strong> William James and Carl Lange.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> "We feel afraid because we run."</li>
            <li><strong>Sequence:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Event (e.g., You see a bear).</li>
                    <li>Physiological Arousal + Behavior (e.g., Your heart pounds, you run).</li>
                    <li>Conscious Emotion (e.g., You interpret your pounding heart and running as "fear").</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In short:</strong> The physical response *causes* the emotion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cannon-Bard Theory</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theorists:</strong> Walter Cannon and Philip Bard.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The theory criticized James-Lange, stating that many emotions have similar physiological responses (e.g., heart pounds when you're angry, afraid, *or* in love).</li>
            <li><strong>Sequence:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Event (e.g., You see a bear).</li>
                    <li>The thalamus in the brain sends signals *simultaneously* to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The cortex (creating the conscious emotion of "fear").</li>
                            <li>The body (creating the physiological arousal of a pounding heart).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In short:</strong> The physical response and the conscious emotion happen at the <strong>same time</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> The key difference is the timing and cause.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>James-Lange:</strong> Body response happens <em>first</em>, which then <em>causes</em> the emotion. (Event -> Body -> Emotion)</li>
                <li><strong>Cannon-Bard:</strong> Body response and emotion happen <em>at the same time</em>. (Event -> Brain -> Body + Emotion)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Emotional Maturity</h3>
        <p>Emotional maturity is the ability to control and express one's emotions in an appropriate and constructive way, according to the social situation. It involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moving from external to internal control of emotions.</li>
            <li>Expressing emotions verbally rather than physically (e.g., saying "I'm angry" instead of hitting).</li>
            <li>Being able to delay gratification.</li>
            <li>Having empathy and understanding others' emotions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Educational Implication of Emotion and Interest</h3>
        <p>(See also "Interest" below)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emotions affect learning:</strong> Positive emotions (like curiosity, joy) *enhance* learning and memory. Negative emotions (like fear, anxiety, boredom) *block* learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Teacher:</strong> The teacher's primary job is to create a <strong>positive emotional climate</strong> in the classroomâone that is supportive, safe, and free from fear or ridicule.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest is key:</strong> Arouse students' interest and curiosity to foster positive emotions and attention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic4">4. Memory</h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Factors of Memory</h3>
        <p>Memory is the mental process of <strong>encoding</strong> (getting information in), <strong>storing</strong> (keeping it), and <strong>retrieving</strong> (getting it out) information.</p>
        
        <h4>Factors of Memorization (How to Improve Memory):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attention:</strong> You cannot remember what you did not pay attention to.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest:</strong> We remember things we are interested in.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningfulness:</strong> It's easier to remember meaningful information (e.g., a story) than nonsense syllables (e.g., "GEX").</li>
            <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Grouping information (e.g., "chunking" a phone number) improves memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaced Practice:</strong> Spreading out study sessions (e.g., 1 hour a day) is better than "cramming" all at once (massed practice).</li>
            <li><strong>Overlearning:</strong> Continuing to practice even after you've "just learned" it makes the memory stronger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Memory</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> The briefest stage (1-3 seconds). It's a "snapshot" of sensory input (e.g., the image you see when you blink).</li>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Limited. "The magical number 7, plus or minus 2" items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Brief, around 15-30 seconds unless rehearsed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Function:</strong> It's the "workbench" of the mind where we actively process information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Memory (LTM):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Virtually unlimited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Relatively permanent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types:</strong> Includes <em>procedural memory</em> (how to do things, e.g., ride a bike) and <em>declarative memory</em> (facts, e.g., "Paris is the capital of France").</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Methods of Memorization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rote Memorization:</strong> Simple repetition (e.g., chanting multiplication tables). It is not very effective for complex ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Elaborative Rehearsal:</strong> Connecting new information to what you already know. This is the best way to move info to LTM.</li>
            <li><strong>Mnemonics:</strong> Memory aids (e.g., acronyms like VIBGYOR for rainbow colors, or using mental imagery).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5">5. Forgetting</h2>

        <h3>Meaning and Causes of Forgetting</h3>
        <p>Forgetting is the inability to retrieve information that was previously stored in memory.</p>
        
        <h4>Causes of Forgetting:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Decay Theory:</strong> Memory traces ("engrams") fade over time if they are not used. (Applies mostly to STM).</li>
            <li><strong>Interference Theory:</strong> Other memories get in the way of what you are trying to recall.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proactive Interference:</strong> <strong>P</strong>ast learning interferes with new learning. (e.g., you write your old address on a new form).</li>
                    <li><strong>Retroactive Interference:</strong> <strong>R</strong>ecent learning interferes with old learning. (e.g., after learning Spanish, you forget some of your high school French).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Retrieval Failure:</strong> The memory is in LTM, but you can't access it. (e.g., the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon).</li>
            <li><strong>Motivated Forgetting (Repression):</strong> Sigmund Freud's idea that we unconsciously push painful or traumatic memories out of our awareness.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Curve of Forgetting</h3>
        <p>Studied by <strong>Hermann Ebbinghaus</strong> (who used himself as a subject to memorize nonsense syllables).</p>
        <p>The forgetting curve shows that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We forget <strong>very rapidly</strong> in the first few hours after learning.</li>
            <li>The rate of forgetting then <strong>slows down</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Reviewing material soon after the lesson is crucial to prevent this rapid initial drop.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic6">6. Interest</h2>

        <h3>Meaning, Types, and Factors of Interest</h3>
        <p>Interest is a feeling of liking and attention towards an object, person, or activity. It is a powerful motivator.</p>
        
        <h4>Types of Interest:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Innate Interest:</strong> Natural interests we are born with (e.g., in food, play).</li>
            <li><strong>Acquired Interest:</strong> Interests we develop through experience and education (e.g., in history, chess).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Factors Affecting Interest:</h4>
        <p>Similar to factors of attention (Age, gender, culture, family, needs, and opportunities).</p>

        <h3>Relation between Attention and Interest</h3>
        <p><span id="spap_2">Attention and Interest are <strong>two sides of the same coin.</strong></span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest is latent attention:</strong> When you are interested in something, you have the *potential* to pay attention to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention is interest in action:</strong> When you are actively paying attention, you are showing your interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You cannot force someone to pay attention for long if they have no interest. Therefore, the teacher's job is not to "demand attention" but to <strong>"create interest"</strong>, which will then capture attention automatically.</p>

        <h3>Meaning, Characteristics, and Types</h3>
        <p>An instinct is a complex, <strong>inborn, unlearned pattern of behavior</strong> that is universal to a species. (e.g., a bird building a nest, a spider spinning a web).</p>
        
        <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>They are innate (not learned).</li>
            <li>They are universal (all members of the species have them).</li>
