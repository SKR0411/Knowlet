        </div>

        <h2 id="president">The President</h2>
        <p>The President of India (Articles 52-62) is the head of the Indian state. He is the first citizen of India and acts as the symbol of unity, integrity, and solidarity of the nation. He is the **nominal/de jure executive**.</p>
        
        <h3>Election</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The President is elected not directly by the people but by members of an **electoral college**.</li>
            <li>The electoral college consists of:
                <ol>
                    <li>The elected members of both the Houses of Parliament (MPs).</li>
                    <li>The elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states (MLAs).</li>
                    <li>The elected members of the legislative assemblies of the Union Territories of Delhi and Puducherry.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The election is held in accordance with the system of **proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote** and the voting is by secret ballot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impeachment Procedure (Article 61)</h3>
        <p>The President can be removed from office for 'violation of the Constitution' through a process of impeachment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The impeachment charges can be initiated by either House of Parliament.</li>
            <li>The charges must be signed by at least one-fourth of the members of the House, and a 14-day notice must be given to the President.</li>
            <li>After the impeachment resolution is passed by a **special majority (two-thirds of the total membership)** of that House, it is sent to the other House.</li>
            <li>The other House investigates the charges. The President has the right to appear and to be represented at such an investigation.</li>
            <li>If the other House also sustains the charges and passes the resolution by a special majority, the President stands removed from his office.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Point:</strong> Impeachment is a quasi-judicial procedure in the Parliament. No Indian President has ever been impeached.
        </div>

        <h3>Powers and Functions</h3>
        <p>The President's powers are extensive but are exercised, in practice, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.</p>

        <h2 id="pm">Prime Minister</h2>
        
        <h3>Appointment and Role</h3>
        <p>The Prime Minister (PM) is the **real/de facto executive** authority. **Article 75** states that the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President. The President appoints the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha as the PM.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            The Prime Minister is the "keystone of the cabinet arch" and "primus inter pares" (first among equals).
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Role and Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Head of Government:</strong> He is the head of the Union Council of Ministers.</li>
            <li><strong>Link between President and Cabinet:</strong> He communicates all decisions of the cabinet to the President.</li>
            <li><strong>Leader of the House:</strong> As the leader of the majority party, he is the leader of the Lok Sabha.</li>
            <li><strong>Chief Spokesperson:</strong> He is the chief spokesperson of the Union government.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign Policy Architect:</strong> Plays a significant role in shaping the country's foreign policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Chairman of Key Bodies:</strong> He is the chairman of the NITI Aayog, National Integration Council, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="com">Union Council of Ministers</h2>

        <h3>Composition</h3>
        <p>The Council of Ministers (CoM) is the body of ministers, headed by the PM, that aids and advises the President. **Article 74** states there shall be a CoM with the PM at the head to aid and advise the President.</p>
        <p>It consists of three categories of ministers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cabinet Ministers:</strong> Head important ministries. They form the 'Cabinet', which is the highest decision-making body.</li>
            <li><strong>Ministers of State:</strong> Can be given independent charge of ministries/departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers.</li>
            <li><strong>Deputy Ministers:</strong> Attached to cabinet ministers or ministers of state to assist them.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Powers and Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The CoM is the real executive in the Indian political system.</li>
            <li>It formulates and determines the policies of the government.</li>
            <li>It has control over the national finance.</li>
            <li>It introduces most of the bills in the Parliament.</li>
            <li>It advises the President on making appointments to key constitutional posts.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Key Concept - Collective Responsibility:</strong> This is the bedrock of the parliamentary system, mentioned in **Article 75**. The ministers are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means they "swim and sink together." If a no-confidence motion is passed against the government, the entire council of ministers has to resign.
