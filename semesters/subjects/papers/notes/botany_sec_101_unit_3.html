        <h2 id="topic1">Introduction to Pharmacognosy</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Pharmacognosy:</strong> The study of medicinal drugs derived from natural sources (plants, animals, microbes).
        </blockquote>
        <p>The term comes from two Greek words: <em>'pharmakon'</em> (drug) and <em>'gnosis'</em> (knowledge). It is one of the oldest branches of pharmacy and medicine.</p>
        <p>It involves the study of the <strong>botanical</strong> (scientific name, family), <strong>chemical</strong> (active principles), and <strong>biological</strong> (medicinal use) properties of "crude drugs" (raw, unprocessed natural materials).</p>

        <h2 id="topic2">Systematic position, distinguishing features and uses of following herbs in curing various ailments</h2>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Format:</strong> This section is perfect for "short notes" questions. Be prepared to write a 1-page note on any of these plants, covering all three required points: Systematic Position, Features, and Uses.
