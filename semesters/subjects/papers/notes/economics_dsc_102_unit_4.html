        <h2 id="topic1">Measuring unemployment</h2>
        <p>To measure unemployment, we first divide the adult population into three categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Employed:</strong> People who are currently working (full-time or part-time).</li>
            <li><strong>Unemployed:</strong> People who are not employed, are available for work, and have actively looked for work in the recent past.</li>
            <li><strong>Not in the Labor Force:</strong> People who fit neither of the first two categories (e.g., students, homemakers, retirees, <strong>discouraged workers</strong> who have given up looking).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Key Formulas:</h3>
        <span class="formula">
            Labor Force = Employed + Unemployed
        </span>
        <span class="formula">
            Unemployment Rate = (Number of Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100
        </span>
        <span class="formula">
            Labor Force Participation Rate = (Labor Force / Adult Population) × 100
        </span>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Common Pitfall:</strong> The unemployment rate is <em>not</em> (Unemployed / Population). A person who is not working and <em>not looking</em> for work (e.g., a retiree) is <strong>not</strong> counted as unemployed; they are "not in the labor force."

        <h2 id="topic2">Types of unemployment</h2>
        
        <p>Unemployment can be broken down into several types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Frictional Unemployment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Short-term unemployment that arises from the time it takes for workers to search for new jobs that best suit their skills and tastes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nature:</strong> It is "search" unemployment. It is unavoidable and occurs even in a healthy, dynamic economy (e.g., graduates looking for their first job, people moving between jobs).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2. Structural Unemployment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Long-term unemployment that arises from a <strong>mismatch</strong> between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills required for available jobs.</li>
                    * <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Technological change (automation), globalization (jobs moving overseas), or changes in the structure of the economy (e.g., decline of the coal industry).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. Cyclical Unemployment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Unemployment caused by a downturn in the business cycle (a recession). It is due to a <strong>deficiency of aggregate demand</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nature:</strong> When the economy slows down, firms lay off workers. This is the type of unemployment Keynesian policies (fiscal/monetary) aim to fix.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU):</strong> This is the "normal" rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is at "full employment." It is the sum of <strong>Frictional + Structural</strong> unemployment.
            <br>
            <strong>Actual Unemployment = Natural Rate + Cyclical Unemployment</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 id="topic3">Inflation: Meaning, Inflationary Gap</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning of Inflation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Inflation</strong> is a <strong>sustained increase</strong> in the <strong>general price level</strong> of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sustained:</strong> A one-time jump in prices is not inflation.</li>
            <li><strong>General:</strong> The price of *one* good (e.g., petrol) rising is not inflation. It must be a broad increase across many goods (as measured by an index like the CPI or GDP Deflator).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Deflation</strong> is the opposite: a sustained *decrease* in the general price level.
        <br><strong>Disinflation</strong> is a *slowing down* of the rate of inflation (e.g., inflation falling from 8% to 5%).</p>
        
        <h3>Inflationary Gap (Keynesian Concept)</h3>
        <p>This gap explains demand-pull inflation in the Keynesian model.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full-Employment Output (Y_f):</strong> The level of national income (GDP) where the economy is at its natural rate of unemployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflationary Gap:</strong> A situation where the <strong>actual equilibrium output (Y*) is greater than the full-employment output (Y_f)</strong>. This happens because Aggregate Expenditure (AE) is *too high*.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the economy is already at full employment, it <em>cannot</em> produce more real output (Y). This excess demand (AE > Y_f) simply pulls up the general price level, causing <strong>demand-pull inflation</strong>. The size of the gap is the vertical distance by which the AE curve is *above* the 45-degree line at the full-employment level (Y_f).</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">Types, Causes and Consequences of Inflation</h2>
        
        <h3>Types of Inflation (by speed)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creeping Inflation:</strong> Slow and mild (e.g., 1-3% per year). Generally considered healthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking Inflation:</strong> Moderate (e.g., 3-10% per year). A warning sign.</li>
            <li><strong>Galloping Inflation:</strong> High (e.g., 10-100% per year). Causes serious economic distortions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyperinflation:</strong> Extremely rapid (e.g., 50% *per month* or more). Money becomes worthless. (e.g., 1920s Germany, Zimbabwe).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Causes of Inflation (The Two Main Theories)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Demand-Pull Inflation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slogan:</strong> "Too much money chasing too few goods."</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Occurs when Aggregate Demand (AD) increases and "pulls" prices up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Increased government spending (G), tax cuts (boosting C), expansionary monetary policy (boosting M), or a rise in exports (X).</li>
                    <li><strong>Model:</strong> The AD curve shifts to the right.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Push Inflation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slogan:</strong> "Too few goods for the money."</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Occurs when Aggregate Supply (AS) decreases due to a rise in the cost of production, which "pushes" prices up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> A rise in oil prices (an "supply shock"), a rise in wages, or a natural disaster that destroys crops/factories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model:</strong> The AS curve shifts to the left.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Consequences of Inflation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Redistribution of Income and Wealth:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hurts:</strong> People on fixed incomes (pensioners), savers (the real value of their savings falls), and lenders (get paid back with "cheaper" money).</li>
                    <li><strong>Helps:</strong> Borrowers (pay back loans with "cheaper" money) and owners of real assets (e.g., property, gold).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> Makes it hard for firms to plan and invest, which can slow economic growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Competitiveness:</strong> If a country's inflation is higher than its trading partners, its exports become more expensive, and imports become cheaper, worsening the trade balance.</li>
            <li><strong>"Menu Costs" and "Shoe-leather Costs":</strong> Menu costs are the costs to firms of constantly changing prices. Shoe-leather costs are the costs to individuals of holding less cash and making more frequent trips to the bank.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic5">Okun's Law</h2>
        <p><strong>Okun's Law</strong> describes the empirical (observed) <strong>negative relationship between unemployment and real GDP</strong>.</p>
        <p>Coined by economist Arthur Okun, the law states that for every 1 percentage point that the <strong>actual unemployment rate</strong> rises above the <strong>natural rate of unemployment (NRU)</strong>, real GDP falls by a certain percentage (e.g., 2-3%).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Core Idea:</strong> When unemployment is high, the economy is not using all its available labor, so it is producing *below* its potential output.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This law provides a quantitative link between the two main macroeconomic problems: high unemployment means lost output (low GDP).</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic6">The trade-off between inflation and unemployment</h2>
        <p>This topic introduces the core concept of the <strong>Phillips Curve</strong>.</p>
        <p>In the short run, policymakers often face a <strong>trade-off</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Policies to <strong>reduce unemployment</strong> (like increasing AD) tend to <strong>increase inflation</strong>.</li>
            <li>Policies to <strong>reduce inflation</strong> (like decreasing AD) tend to <strong>increase unemployment</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This inverse relationship suggests that a country must choose a point on this trade-off: either low unemployment with high inflation, or low inflation with high unemployment. However, this trade-off was found to be unstable.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="topic7">Philip's Curve in the Short run and Long run</h2>
        
        <h3>The Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A <strong>downward-sloping</strong> curve showing the inverse short-run relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> It is based on a specific level of <strong>expected inflation</strong>. If AD increases, firms see demand rise. They hire more workers (unemployment falls) and also raise prices (inflation rises). This is a movement *up along* the SRPC.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">[]</p>
        
        <h3>The Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC)</h3>
        <p>Theorized by <strong>Milton Friedman</strong> and <strong>Edmund Phelps</strong>, this concept argues that in the long run, <strong>there is NO trade-off</strong> between inflation and unemployment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A <strong>vertical line</strong> at the <strong>Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanism (Adaptive Expectations):</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The economy is at the NRU (point A).</li>
                    <li>Govt. uses policy to increase AD, lowering unemployment (moving up the SRPC to point B).</li>
                    <li>Workers now *expect* higher inflation. They demand higher wages.</li>
                    <li>Higher wages raise firms' costs, so they lay off workers. Unemployment returns to the NRU, but now at a permanently higher inflation rate (point C).</li>
                    <li>The SRPC has *shifted up* (from SRPC1 to SRPC2).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Any attempt to keep unemployment below the NRU will only result in accelerating, runaway inflation. The LRPC is vertical, meaning in the long run, the unemployment rate is *independent* of the inflation rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">[]</p>

        <h2 id="topic8">The concept of Stagflation</h2>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Stagflation</strong> is a toxic combination of economic <strong>stagnation</strong> (falling output, high unemployment) and <strong>high inflation</strong>, occurring at the same time.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The 1970s saw a period of global stagflation, primarily caused by the <strong>OPEC oil shocks</strong>. This was a classic <strong>cost-push</strong> inflation scenario.
        <ul>
            <li>The price of oil (a key input) soared.</li>
            <li>This caused a negative <strong>Aggregate Supply shock</strong> (the AS curve shifted to the left).</li>
            <li>A leftward AS shift causes <strong>both</strong> problems simultaneously:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prices rise</strong> (inflation).</li>
                    <li><strong>Output falls</strong> (stagnation/recession, which means high unemployment).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Stagflation *broke* the original, simple Phillips Curve. It showed that it was possible to have high inflation and high unemployment at the same time, proving the short-run trade-off was not stable. This gave credibility to Friedman's long-run (vertical) Phillips Curve theory.</p>
