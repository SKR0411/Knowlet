            <strong>Note on the Unit Title:</strong> The syllabus title is "India in the 300 BCE," but the topics cover the period from the <strong>6th Century BCE to the 4th Century BCE</strong> (approx. 600-300 BCE). This period is a major turning point in Indian history.
        </div>

        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction (The 6th Century BCE)</h2>
        <p>The 6th Century BCE was an age of incredible social, political, and religious ferment. It is often called the <strong>"Second Urbanisation"</strong> in Indian history (the first being the IVC).</p>
        <p>Key developments of this era:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Political:</strong> The old *Janapadas* (territorial states) grew into large kingdoms called <strong>Mahajanapadas</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Widespread use of iron tools led to huge agricultural surpluses, the growth of trade, and the rise of cities.</li>
            <li><strong>Religious:</strong> A strong reaction against the complex, ritualistic, and Brahmin-dominated Later Vedic religion led to the emergence of new philosophies, most notably <strong>Buddhism and Jainism</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="mahajanapada">2. Emergence of Mahajanpada, Rise of Magadha</h2>
        
        <h3>i) Emergence of Mahajanapada</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Around 600 BCE, the Gangetic plains were dotted with <strong>16 great kingdoms</strong>, or Mahajanapadas.</li>
            <li><strong>Source:</strong> This list of 16 is famously given in the Buddhist text <strong>Anguttara Nikaya</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Types:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Monarchies:</strong> Ruled by kings (e.g., Magadha, Kosala, Vatsa, Avanti).</li>
                    <li><strong>Republics (Ganas/Sanghas):</strong> Ruled by an assembly of nobles (e.g., Vajji (Licchavis), Mallas).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This period was marked by intense political competition, with these states fighting each other for supremacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Rise of Magadha</h3>
        <p>Out of the 16 Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of <strong>Magadha</strong> (in modern-day Bihar) eventually emerged as the most powerful, laying the foundation for India's first great empire.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasons for Magadha's Success:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Vastly fertile plains (Ganga valley) and <strong>rich iron ore deposits</strong> (near Rajgir) which were used for better weapons and ploughs.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic:</strong> Its capitals were strategic. <strong>Rajgir</strong> was surrounded by five hills (natural fort). <strong>Pataliputra</strong> (later) was a "water fort" (<em>Jaladurga</em>) at the confluence of four rivers (Ganga, Son, Gandak, Ghaghra), controlling communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Military:</strong> They were the first to use <strong>elephants</strong> on a large scale in warfare.</li>
            <li><strong>Political:</strong> A succession of ambitious and ruthless rulers.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Haryanka Dynasty:</strong> <strong>Bimbisara</strong> (used matrimonial alliances to expand) and his son <strong>Ajatashatru</strong> (waged war to conquer Kosala and the Vajji republic).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shishunaga Dynasty:</strong> Defeated the powerful Avanti kingdom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nanda Dynasty:</strong> Founded by <strong>Mahapadma Nanda</strong>, often called the "first empire builder of India." He defeated all remaining Kshatriya kingdoms. The last Nanda ruler, <strong>Dhana Nanda</strong>, was unpopular and was overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya (who founded the Mauryan Empire, which begins our next paper).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="new-religions">3. Buddhism and Jainism</h2>
        <p>These were the two most prominent movements that arose in the 6th Century BCE against the old Vedic religion. They were both led by Kshatriya princes.</p>

        <h3>i) Jainism: Life & Teachings of Mahavira</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life:</strong> Vardhamana Mahavira was the 24th (and last) <strong>Tirthankara</strong> (ford-maker). He was not the founder, but the great reformer of Jainism.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Teachings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ahimsa (Non-Violence):</strong> This is the central, most extreme principle. Jains believe everything, including rocks and water, has a soul (<em>Jiva</em>) and must not be harmed. This is why Jains often wear masks (to avoid inhaling insects) and practice professions like trade, avoiding agriculture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Vedas & Rituals:</strong> Rejected the authority of the Vedas and the dominance of Brahmins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Karma and Rebirth:</strong> Believed in Karma, but the goal is to *completely* shed all Karma to achieve <strong>Kaivalya</strong> (liberation).</li>
                    <li><strong>Anekantavada:</strong> The philosophy that truth is many-sided and complex.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Five Vows:</strong> Mahavira's followers take five great vows:
                1. <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (Non-violence)
                2. <strong>Satya</strong> (Truth)
                3. <strong>Asteya</strong> (Non-stealing)
                4. <strong>Aparigraha</strong> (Non-possession)
                5. <strong>Brahmacharya</strong> (Celibacy/Chastity) - <em>(This was the one added by Mahavira)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ii) Buddhism: Life & Teachings of Gautama Buddha</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life:</strong> Siddhartha Gautama, a prince. Key events: Birth (Lumbini), Great Renunciation, Enlightenment (Bodh Gaya), First Sermon (Sarnath), Death (Kushinagar).</li>
            <li><strong>Core Teachings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Four Noble Truths:</strong>
                        1. The world is full of suffering (<em>Dukkha</em>).
                        2. The cause of suffering is desire (<em>Tanha</em>).
                        3. Suffering can be ended (by ending desire).
                        4. The way to end suffering is the <strong>Eightfold Path</strong> (<em>Ashtangika Marga</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Middle Path (Madhyama Marga):</strong> The Buddha's core philosophy. It rejects both extremes: the life of indulgence (luxury) and the life of extreme self-torture (austerity). This moderation made it very popular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Vedas & Caste:</strong> Like Jainism, he rejected Vedas, rituals, and the caste system (though less directly than Mahavira).</li>
                    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Taught in <strong>Pali</strong>, the language of the common people, not Sanskrit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Comparing Buddhism & Jainism:</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>Similarities:</strong> Both were Kshatriya princes, rejected Vedas/caste/rituals, believed in Karma/rebirth, and taught in common languages (Pali/Prakrit).
            <br>
            <strong>Differences:</strong> Jainism's concept of <strong>Ahimsa is far more extreme</strong>. Buddhism emphasizes the <strong>Middle Path</strong>, while Jainism advocates for strict austerity.
        </div>

        <h2 id="alexander">4. Alexander's Campaign in India</h2>
        <p><em>(327 BCE – 325 BCE)</em></p>
        <p>In the 4th Century BCE, while Magadha was rising in the east, the northwest of India (Punjab region) was politically fragmented into many small, warring kingdoms.</p>

        <h3>The Invasion:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Alexander, the King of Macedon (Greece), invaded India in 327 BCE after conquering the Persian Empire.</li>
            <li>He crossed the Indus river. <strong>Ambhi (Omphis)</strong>, the ruler of Taxila, surrendered to him without a fight.</li>
            <li><strong>Battle of Hydaspes (326 BCE):</strong> Alexander's most famous battle in India. He faced <strong>King Porus (Paurava)</strong> on the banks of the river Jhelum (Greek: *Hydaspes*). Porus and his elephants fought bravely, but were defeated. Alexander, impressed by his courage, restored his kingdom to him as a vassal.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutiny on the Beas:</strong> Alexander's victorious army wanted to march east (towards the Nanda kingdom), but they mutinied at the river Beas (Greek: *Hyphasis*). They were exhausted, homesick, and intimidated by reports of the massive Nanda army.</li>
            <li><strong>Retreat:</strong> A disappointed Alexander was forced to turn back. He sailed down the Indus river and began his land journey back, dying in Babylon in 323 BCE.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Effects of Alexander's Campaign:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Political:</strong> By destroying the small kingdoms in the northwest, Alexander's invasion
                <strong>paved the way for political unification</strong>. Chandragupta Maurya took advantage of this power vacuum to conquer the region and establish the Mauryan Empire.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural (Indo-Greek Contact):</strong> It opened the first direct line of contact between India and Europe (Greece). This led to a fusion of cultures, most clearly seen later in the <strong>Gandhara School of Art</strong> (Greco-Buddhist art).</li>
            <li><strong>Historical:</strong> It gave Indian history its first "anchor date." The date of the invasion (326 BCE) is a firm, known date in Greek records, which helps us date all other events in relation to it.</li>
        </ol>
