        <h2 id="topic1">1. Definition and Meaning of Health</h2>
        
        <h3>Meaning of Health</h3>
        <p>The word "health" is often misunderstood. Traditionally, health was considered to be simply the <strong>"absence of disease or infirmity."</strong> This is a very narrow and negative definition, as it defines health by what it is *not*.</p>
        
        <h3>Modern Definition (WHO)</h3>
        <p>The most widely accepted modern definition comes from the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> in 1948:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Health is a state of <strong>complete physical, mental, and social well-being</strong> and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This definition is significant because it is <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>multidimensional</strong>. It introduces three key dimensions:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Refers to the efficient functioning of the body. It includes physical fitness, nutrition, and the absence of physical illness.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Includes our emotional, psychological, and cognitive well-being. It's about being able to handle stress, think clearly, and feel good about oneself.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Health:</strong> Refers to our ability to form meaningful relationships, interact with others, and contribute to the community.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="topic2">2. Holistic health - concept and meaning</h2>

        <h3>Concept of Holistic Health</h3>
        <p>The concept of "holistic health" expands on the WHO definition. The word "holistic" comes from the Greek word <em>'holos'</em>, which means <strong>"whole"</strong>.</p>
        <p><span id="spap_1">Holistic health is an approach to wellness that considers the <strong>entire person</strong>—body, mind, spirit, and emotions—and their environment.</span> It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all these aspects.</p>
        <p>If one part is not working correctly, all the other parts will be affected. For example, high mental stress (mind) can lead to high blood pressure (body). A poor social life (social) can lead to depression (emotional).</p>
        
        <h3>Meaning and Dimensions of Holistic Health</h3>
        <p>Holistic health is about achieving an optimal balance in all aspects of life. Its main dimensions include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Physical Dimension:</strong> Achieved through proper nutrition, exercise, sleep, and avoiding harmful substances.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental/Intellectual Dimension:</strong> Keeping the mind active, curious, and learning new things.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Dimension:</strong> Understanding, accepting, and expressing one's feelings in a healthy way. This includes coping with stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Dimension:</strong> Nurturing healthy relationships with family, friends, and the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Dimension:</strong> This is not necessarily religious. It refers to having a sense of purpose, meaning, and values in life. It's about a connection to one's inner self and the world.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="exam-tip">
            <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> A key difference is that the traditional "biomedical model" treats the *disease* or *symptom*, while the "holistic model" treats the *whole person*. Yoga and Life Skill Education are perfect examples of a holistic approach.

        <h2 id="topic3">3. Definition, Meaning and Importance of Physical Education</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Meaning</h3>
        <p>Physical Education is often confused with just sports or playing games. However, it is a much broader educational process.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "Physical Education is an integral part of the total education process... a field of endeavor which has as its aim the development of physically, mentally, emotionally and socially fit citizens through the medium of physical activities..." - <em>Charles A. Bucher</em>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Physical Education is <strong>"Education *through* the physical."</strong> It uses physical activities (like sports, games, gymnastics, yoga) as the *medium* to teach and develop the *whole* person.</p>
        
        <h3>Importance of Physical Education</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Development:</strong> This is the most obvious one. It improves cardiovascular health, muscular strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination.</li>
            <li><strong>Motor Skill Development:</strong> It refines gross and fine motor skills, which are essential for all life activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Development:</strong> Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, improving alertness, concentration, and relieving stress. It also teaches rules, strategies, and problem-solving.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Development:</strong> Team sports and group activities are crucial for learning teamwork, leadership, cooperation, and <strong>sportsmanship</strong> (how to win and lose gracefully).</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Development:</strong> It provides a healthy outlet for energy and emotions. It helps in building self-confidence, self-esteem, and emotional control.</li>
            <li><strong>Development of Healthy Habits:</strong> It instills the value of regular exercise and healthy living from a young age, which is crucial for a long-term "healthy life."</li>
        </ul>
