    <h2 id="intro">1.1 Computer Definition & Characteristics</h2>
    <h3>Computer Definition</h3>
    <blockquote>
        A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. It takes raw data as input, processes it according to a set of instructions (a program), and produces a result (output).
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Characteristics of Computers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Computers can perform billions of calculations per second. Their speed is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Computers are highly accurate. Errors, if any, are usually due to human error (incorrect data or instructions), not technological flaws. This is often referred to as GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).</li>
        <li><strong>Diligence:</strong> Unlike humans, a computer is free from monotony, tiredness, and lack of concentration. It can work continuously for hours without creating any errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Computers are multi-purpose. They can perform a wide variety of tasks, from simple calculations to complex simulations, entertainment, and communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> Computers can store vast amounts of data and retrieve it almost instantaneously. The storage capacity is growing exponentially with advancements in technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Once a program is loaded into the computer's memory, the computer can execute it automatically without human intervention until the task is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Modern computers are very reliable. They have a long life and their components rarely break down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="evolution">1.2 Evolution of Computers & Applications</h2>
    <h3>Evolution of Computers (Generations)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Generation (1940s-1950s):</strong> Used <strong>vacuum tubes</strong> for circuitry. They were massive, expensive, and generated a lot of heat. Programming was done in machine language. Examples: ENIAC, UNIVAC.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Generation (1950s-1960s):</strong> Replaced vacuum tubes with <strong>transistors</strong>, making computers smaller, faster, cheaper, and more reliable. Assembly language and early high-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were introduced.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Generation (1960s-1970s):</strong> Characterized by the use of <strong>Integrated Circuits (ICs)</strong>. This allowed for even smaller computers with keyboards and monitors. Operating systems were developed. Examples: IBM-360 series.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Generation (1970s-Present):</strong> Based on <strong>microprocessors</strong>, which packed thousands of ICs onto a single silicon chip. This led to the development of personal computers (PCs). GUIs, mice, and handheld devices emerged.</li>
        <li><strong>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond):</strong> Focuses on <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, parallel processing, and quantum computing. Aims to develop devices that can respond to natural language and are capable of learning and self-organization.</li>

    <h2 id="organization">1.4 Basic Organization of a Digital Computer</h2>
    <p>The basic organization of a computer system is based on the <strong>Von Neumann architecture</strong>. It consists of five major components.</p>
    <div class="exam-tip">
        <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Always draw the Von Neumann Architecture diagram when asked about the basic organization of a computer. It clearly shows the relationship between the CPU, Memory, and I/O units.
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Input Unit:</strong> Takes data and instructions from the user. (e.g., Keyboard, Mouse)</li>
        <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The "brain" of the computer. It processes the data. It has two main sub-units:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> Directs and coordinates most of the operations in the computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Memory Unit:</strong> Stores data, instructions, and intermediate results. (e.g., RAM, ROM)</li>
        <li><strong>Output Unit:</strong> Presents the processed data (information) to the user. (e.g., Monitor, Printer)</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Unit:</strong> Stores data and programs permanently for future use. (e.g., Hard Disk, SSD)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="design-arch">1.5 Computer Design vs. Computer Architecture</h2>
    <h3>Computer Architecture</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Refers to the attributes of a system visible to a programmer. It's the <strong>what</strong>. It includes the instruction set, number of bits used for data, I/O mechanisms, and addressing techniques. Example: The specification that a processor will have a multiplication instruction.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Computer Organization</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Refers to the operational units and their interconnections that realize the architectural specifications. It's the <strong>how</strong>. It includes details like control signals, interfaces between the computer and peripherals, and the memory technology used. Example: How the multiplication instruction is implemented (e.g., using a dedicated hardware unit or repeated addition).
    </blockquote>
    <div class="exam-tip">
        <strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of designing a car. <strong>Architecture</strong> is deciding it will have four wheels, an engine, and seats for five people. <strong>Organization</strong> is deciding the specific type of engine, the material for the seats, and how the steering wheel connects to the wheels.
    </div>
